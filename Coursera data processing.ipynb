      "0  -means-  or GamificationFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Víctor M R•Feb 14, 2019The course itself is not bad, if you do not have previous knowledge in gamification. It's a good introduction that covers a few important aspects of this relatively new discipline. But you can feel many times that many of the lessons are already out of date (just take a look at the examples the teacher provides) and the situation of the market the teacher describes is gone. There are new issues and new challenges. Another important flaw, from my point of view is that he doesn't delve into the analysis of the examples, which would be much more practical, useful and interesting than trying to cover the course with this kind of pseudo-academic patina.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Evgeny T•Feb 24, 2019Good course for starters. But i think it's need to an updated version, due to it's launch date - 2012, there is a lot things happens into gamification subject.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Anshuman G•Jul 02, 2017It was an interesting learning session -  it gave me a more structured approach to gamification concepts which I can further use in Human Computer Interaction / User Centered Design approach in UX.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Maryna A•Jul 21, 2019One of the best courses I've ever had online. The topic of gamification is still new, so this course was the first and the only place where I could find all the necessary information. Every lecture contains a lot of data, so my strong advice is to follow carefully and make notes - you will definitely want ot get back to them. You will find articles, videos and books, advised by professor, if you want to dive deeper into the topic. This was also valuable to me, because there are a lot of books on game design, but you never know which ones are worth reading.  I work at the educational market, and I have already started implementing the principles of the course at my own course programs. I feel this is what I was looking for to make a boost for my business.

The course is designed very well & wisely, which is delivering the expected objective seamlessly.

However, the content of this course is actually quite barren, practices are easy and not closely refective of the corresponding videos. The fourth week is most interesting and I was happy to know that multiple imputation is actually not key on the \"imputation\" part. It emphasizes the fact that missingness should be considered as uncertainty in modelling. After all, this is a interesting course and can be better designed and delievered. Thanks to the team.

The course resources comprise of videos and notes.  The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking.  Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes.  Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources.  As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning.  A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it.  However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials.  Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Réjane F R•Dec 22, 2016The contents of this course could be interesting, but they end up being terribly boring.

There also appeared to be technical issues in the quizzes wherein the correct responses were often returned as incorrect & vice-versa, for a few quizzes.

The quizzes are well designed to test the student's understanding.I'm giving the course 4, rather than 5, for two reasons: a lack of further reading, which many other courses provide; and the forums are almost completely dead. Generally I learn by discussing things with other students, with help from the instructors when needed. The course could work better, IMHO. This should not be interpreted as a criticism of Prof Djorgovski'slectures, which are worthy of Caltech!\n",

I learned a lot and it sparked my interest to study more about astronomy. The only caveats I have to offer here are that this course is not for total beginners: a student really needs to have a background in basic calculus and physics in order to get anything out of the course.  Sometimes it feels like the professor is presenting results at a research conference rather than teaching students with no astronomy background---which can be exciting to watch but it can also be baffling to beginners. Also, I felt the course presented a little too much material for a single session, perhaps the course should be split into two parts? Other than that, highly recommended.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Manuel B•Jan 27, 2018Great course!

As such, the video lectures are mostly useless.  Most topics are covered in a very brief fashion, if at all.  Some of the Week 4 lectures are a huge 58 seconds long!  There is little to nothing in the lectures to help with the quizzes and MatLab exercises.  Reading the resources can help, but why pay Coursera so that you can be told to read Wikipedia?  The Week 4 resources included videos from Khan Academy and Udemy (or was it Udacity), so what exactly are we paying Coursera for?  The final straw for me was the Week 4 Image Segmentation MatLab exercise - the code we got to start with seemed complete, so I ran it as-is, and scored 100% without even editing a single line of code.  What is the point of that?

      "14  -means-  r Computer Vision BasicsFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Dhritiman S•Apr 26, 2019I'll start with the positive. There were some lectures (Pinhole Camera Model) which were effective. However, this course was extremely superficial.I'm not sure what the intention of this course was. All the material in the entire course could have been presented over the course of one week. The lectures were mere minutes long and extremely superficial. There was no practical guidance whatsoever with respect to the assignments. I passed the assignments through a lot of trial and error and by relying on prior knowledge of computer-vision and programming.There were times when the lecturer would mention that certain algorithms would be covered in the next lecture, only to jump to another topic altogether. Not sure if the course content was accidentally uploaded like this. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (15)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy An M C•May 26, 2019This course should have a zero star.  TA's are not answering the questions on the forum discussion.  Both lectures and assignments are very poor in quality.  It's a BIG SHAME that the University of Buffalo has such a crappy material and expects people to pay for it.  It's a waste of time!!!

No practical concepts were taught by the instructors. If they didn't taught any practical concepts then why they are asking in assignments. They didn't even tell ABCD about Matlab and aspect us to solve assignments in Matlab. This is ridiculous. They should have given at least some examples  to solve the assignments. I am highly disappointed with the assignment part. Rest theoretical part was good and  to the point but could be more detailed.

More guidance probably should be given for the matlab assignment or it get really frustrating after 6 hrs stuck at the same position struggling to guess the real answer. You should at least familiar with matlab operation for getting started in this one. \"intermediate level\" is pretty accurate. I am a undergrad year-2  EE student at a Top 10 UK uni and this still remains a bit challenging. The overall level is OK but sometimes stuck at a same place for hours really make me wants to give up for some time. But overall its a really good course but probably for for a total beginner.   Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Evan R•Jun 17, 2019There isn't enough in the free version of the course to push me to make a purchase. If Matlab guidance is lacking on some examples I have no faith it would be any better once I unlock the assignments.

Very superficial. What is the point of this? For example you mentioned Least Squares. In a 1 minute video. Great, what is it? How do I apply it? Nothing, instead in the optional material you send me to a pdf from a University of Puget Sound (what?!) that mentions I was supposed to learn in the class. Huh? And this happens with every concept, some names and terms are being thrown, even the quizes that are being asked right after don't always correlate with it, and in most cases you have to use your intuition, as what is being asked was not explained.

Why do I say that?  Well a typical week consists of watching a few videos where the Indian bloke waves his right hand around in a very annoying/distracting manner, followed by some multiple choice quizzes that have little to do with the video you just watched, and that the videos do not necessarily prepare you to answer.  Then they want you to read some Wikipedia pages, and finally there's a problem that has to be solved with MATLAB.  Again, there is little to nothing in the material presented in the lectures to help you solve the graded problems.  At best, this course reminded me of stuff I mostly already knew, and enabled me to brush up on my rusty MATLAB programming skills.  This is an interesting topic, and the course could have been so much better.  Definitely not good value for the money.  On the plus side, it only takes a few hours a week for 4 weeks to complete the whole thing, and they don't make you grade your fellow students' homework - the grading is automated.

I was impressed by the careful organization not only of the topics, but also of the exercises, especially the optional ones, which really helped to dive into specific details of the material, and were key to see things in practice. I have one suggestion for improvement. Although the videos were all of high quality, I think having 5-10 min videos with a single person speaking in front of a camera is not effective in conveying messages, especially because it is clear they are reading from a script. People behave and communicate more effectively when they are not reading directly form a curated text. the results is that reading the transcript of the video was better than watching the video itself. My suggestion would be to have conversations and/or debates on video, and leave detailed information for the written material. Finally the entire course was impressive for the knowledge and expertise of all the people involved, and despite my limited time I have also learned some important from the discussion forums.

      "19  -means-  r Successful PresentationFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy R.J. L•Jul 19, 2017This review is written to discourage you to take this course. The classes do not teach presenting skills and the teacher is an awful presenter himself. There are lots more valuable courses capable of teaching you how to present.\n",
      "The current course is not about presenting in a business setting. It is about anxiety, fear, and storytelling. It does not teach skills that will help pursue your audience. The lectures are focused on giving you pointers to cope with anxiety instead. Professional presentations are about more than the ability to fearlessly tell stories. Therefore, “Successful Presentation” falls short.\n",
      "Additionally, the lecturer does not present well himself. He is exaggerating all aspects of public speaking. This makes him come across as being unauthentic. He overemphasizes every word he says, which makes him appear as if he is putting up an act. This distracted me from the content and made me question everything he stated.\n",
      "Students need to complete this course to obtain the degree for the “Effective Communication” specialization. I will finish this course only for that reason. If you want to just increase your public speaking skills, I highly recommend forgoing this course. It will not teach you these skills and the presenter will annoy you. Coursera has some exquisite courses on similar topics. I would go for one focused on persuading audiences that is given by a public speaker you esteem.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (4)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Marie A O•Sep 16, 2017I truly needed this course.

Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course.  Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content.  I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching.  If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating.  Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating.  But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy.  You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost.  Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through.  While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching.  And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers.  I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher.  There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here.  \"I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to\" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're \"stocked\" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that \"we're going to run some narly regressions\", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants.  These segments add absolutely zero value.  They lengthen the time of the course.  To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Rakib H C•May 26, 2019Really, a practical course.

It helped me to understand the connections between similar characters and also taught me a few new vocabulary words.  I also feel that I gained an understanding in the thinking of Chinese people and culture by learning about these characters.  Distinguishing between the strokes also helped me to recognize the differences between similar characters.  I love the lack of English used in this course as well.  One major con for this course is that the tests require that students have some intermediate understanding of Chinese grammar.  If this course is truly for beginners,  then either those grammar aspects should be explained in the course or the fill in the blank sentences should be altered in some way that allows students to answer with limited knowledge of grammar.  The good thing is that there's usually only one or two questions like that on each test. Also, some of the slides in the middle of the course also got messed up in some way where they skip over characters or repeat characters multiple times.  That was confusing,  but not impossible to understand.  It needs to be fixed though. Thanks to everyone who put this course together. I appreciate your hard work. 谢谢您们。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Shanti S•Mar 13, 2017This course helps me understand better about the Chinese characters than just reading books.

Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy James K R•Nov 05, 2017Well Worth the Effort!Having just completed the HSK Prep Certification Course, I knew I needed to focus on recognizing and understanding basic Chinese Characters. Completing this course has required me to continue daily contact with the Mandarin language skills from the HSK course and improve (somewhat), the vital reading and (to some extent) writing skills necessary to fully develop facility with this language. I recommend this course of study specifically for those who've had an introduction to Mandarin, since the material here is (in my opinion) contextual and (of course) grounded in the grammatical structures of Mandarin, without a prior introduction this course material may appear abstract and self-referential. I found the course to be a reinforcement of the lessons learned and not-quite learned during my HSK Prep course. Thank you for the well structured opportunity to continue my growth.

As a lecturer who already holds a PhD and teaches similar introductions at Honours, Masters and PhD level I should know. However, the assessment is not well explained or aligned with the course content and the options in the assessment allow students to choose an easier path for the same marks. It also assumes a lot of extra knowledge not covered in the course about day-to-day business interactions, which may differ in various cultural contexts. It doesn't test students' knowledge of the course material so much as test their recognition of 'issues', which is fine if that's what you're looking for.Note that instructors and mentors rarely respond to enquiries and you are entirely dependent on peer reviews to pass. This means that you are dependent on your peers not only to be fair and to be competent reviewers, it also means you are dependent on their timing so you cannot complete the course at your own pace.

Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn't figure out what the correct answer was. Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared.

The only downside is the lack of responses from anyone (including mods) on the discussion forums.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Anand P•Aug 19, 2018supportive courseThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy 陈章敏•Oct 02, 2018I think it provides me with useful skillsThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Adway U •Oct 05, 2018very elaborate course on networkingThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Madhura N•Jan 08, 2018Great course and assignments!

The biggest was the lack of alignment between weeks 4 and 5 (which would be better placed in Module 2) and the rest of it. It got worse due to the lack of Stepik support and material in the textbooks that would in theory accompany the course.

Il est exceptionnel de qualité et pêche par beaucoup d'aspects. La qualité de l'enseignement est excellent, les exercices sont très bien corrigés en revanche il manque un support PDF. Evidemment le livre de Sylvie Méléard est très bien mais beaucoup plus résumé que le cours donc pas vraiment intéressant pour retrouver les démonstrations et surtout les raisonnements. Les modélisations en javascripts sont très bien faites aussi. Les quiz sont accessibles même à mon niveau et plus faciles que les exercices.Ce qui gène c'est que l'on ne sait pas pour qui ce cours est construit. Pour des X première année? Ils l'ont déjà suivi. Donc pour qui ? Moi je l'ai suivi pour avoir le bagage qui me permette de raccourcir mon temps de traitement dans la construction de modèles prédictifs en filtrant en amont mes données. Et de ce côté je suis resté un peu sur ma faim car cela manque d'aspects pratiques. Encore une fois quelle est la cible ? Les matheux ne suivent pas les moocs surtout à ce niveau. Et je ne parle pas du fait que le cours soit en français ce qui expliquerait pourquoi je me suis retrouvé seul dans le forum.Sinon je donne une super note car Sylvie Méléard rend les maths accessibles et donne le courage de la suivre ce qui n'est pas toujours aisé.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Le B Y•May 01, 2019J'ai beaucoup aimé l'aspect simulation.Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",
      "50  -means-  r Advanced Search Engine Optimization StrategiesFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy Laura M•May 27, 2019I gave up watching the videos after Week 2 and simply read the transcriptions to complete the course. The videos are painful to watch. I am sure Mr. Lloyd is a smart man who knows the material, but he definitely lacks in the teaching/public speaking area. He was obviously reading from a teleprompter and seemed as if he did not acquaint himself with the material before recording the lessons. There were pauses in places where pauses did not belong and then faster reading in places where it would have been better to slow down.  \"Stage presence\" was horrible with periods where he nervously rocked side to side, times when he was squinting and obviously struggling to read the teleprompter, and times when he just had a glazed look in his eyes as if he had no idea what he was reading. This all unfortunately  served as a distraction from the course content.  Add to this the fact that a good bit of the material is out-of-date since some of the SEO tools mentioned no longer exist. For these reasons I would highly recommend the videos for this course be redone, preferably by another instructor. Or, at the very least, send him to Toastmasters Club for a few months before he rerecords the videos.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (4)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Hien N•Aug 18, 2016This course was very helpful.

The only complaint I have isn't with this course in particular but seems to happen frequently in various Coursera courses.  I submitted my week 3 assignment 2 days late but the course was still going on for another couple of weeks so I didn't think my assignment would not get graded.   I tried live chat, learner help until finally I kept posting in the forums begging someone to grade my course.  Finally I got a response from a mentor, Michael Fortune who really offered help to me.  There was something wrong with my link that I still need to find out what it was.  It wasn't until the next session of this course had completed until Michael, who stuck it out with me trying and ultimately succeeding in getting other students to grade my assignment so I could complete my course and move on to the Capstone Project.I still enjoyed the course despite all that time it took Michael and I to get the assignment graded.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Varun B•Apr 22, 2018Very informative.

I wasn't game to try the quizzes until I had downloaded the book on my iPad and read chapter six, glad I did and will use this as my weekly process.  Enjoying this course very much. Week 2 quizzes were more testing, took three attempts at both quiz 3 and quiz 4 even though I passed on first attempt: 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 5 out of 6 / 6 out of 6. I like the dialogue format and that the language style is in modern conversational English. Socrates guy is hard to please, but he still forces us to think after 2,000 years. Pity the Greeks don't have him around today, their economy might be in better shape. The dentist at our local shopping centre is called Socrates but I don't believe they are related.

It opened a window to logic and living.  It was an exercise in critical thinking which one needs at any age.  Also, I now realize that I need to improve my reading skills and plan to do so. I recommend that the course have a sequel.  Why not do all of the Republic?  Also, it would be helpful if the professor explained not only which quizz answers were wrong but why. We are trying to learn, not only pass the  course. This is philosophy, after all. Finally, why do the students in Singapur get two additional weeks?  How about us?I am a Colombian.  Although I speak and write (sort of) English, it would be great to have Spanish subtitles for the lectures.  Unfortunately, the Spanish translations of the dialogues may be a problem.  I haven´t found any in Cartagena (my home) or on the internet. I do have La República in  Spanish  with a translation by José Manuel Pabón and Manuel Fernández-Galiano.  However, it's very Spanish (from Spain) and for us it seems stilted.  Maybe its like the English translations by Benjamin Jowett. Perhaps the answer is to study ancient Greek.  Please let Coursera know.

      "72  -means-  or Fundamentals of Visualization with TableauFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy Mykola S•Aug 24, 2016This course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week. Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant. Secondly, practical assignments are very poorly planned: 1) in weeks 3 peer graded assignment students are asked to save Tableau workbooks as twbx files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableau Public that is used in this course. The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau. 2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.Overall, this course is just a waste of time. For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableau from the 4 minute long \"Getting started\" video on the Tableau website than from  this course. Just wonder how Coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Katrina•Sep 09, 2018The content might be ok but the support on this course is ridiculous. Mentors/teachers don't respond in the discussions which means assignments are poorly understood. Then 'peer graded assignments' are a joke - how can a peer grade you when they don't even understand the assignment cause its so poorly written. I got completely opposite grading from two different people, meaning one is clearly wrong but both count as my 'grade' - don't bother with this course, save up a few months and go to a real course where you can speak to the teacher and don't have depend on morons scoring your assignments.

Yes, its an introduction and you can't do much in an intro course... but...The Tableau parts have no real added value on top of what's available for free on Tableau's site.  The Week 3 assignment was very frustrating, it was poorly worded and the instructions to export didn't work for the Tableau Desktop that I had installed as per the course instructions.  The assignment should have been a consolidation but it was the first time that we played around with data sources.The Week 4 assignment did not use Tableau at all.It would have been much better to have had one example to follow through from start (obtain data, prep, import) to creating a Visualisation that was part of the course work.  Then add some assignments that allow you to build on what you've already seen.In terms of visualisation terms and concepts, this was very light and relied on some other well known (& readily available) material.As the content was very light I was able to finish the course in a lot less time than the course overview estimates, well, everything other than the confusing Week 3 assignment.  I won't be continuing with the specialisation.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Barbara S•Jan 30, 2019I am so happy I took this course.

In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about  all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.

And close-ups shots of people smoking aren't too suitable in the work environment. The male instructor's smirking face whilst shots are being taken on campus is really off-putting and inappropriate. The code is just given to you; it would be far better if the course guided you through it.

They provide a plethora of coding assignments and tests throughout the courses. They are thus helping us revise what we had learned a couple of lectures back by applying the knowledge to write actual codes. Discussion in weely forums helps clear doubts.

This course has definitely provided me with the necessary skills and confidence to use it in solving MATLAB problems. The syllabus has been amazingly designed.One negative thing that I felt about this course was level of difficulty of last 2-3 weeks for a beginner.

The teachers want other students to be the help which is fine but when that help is lacking you can get stuck with no recourse, which is what I'm currently facing. I understand what is required (coding 4 datetime functions) and I believe have coded them correctly except for one line, that for the life of me can't figure out why it doesn't work. That one line of code is causing the function to not work correctly and because the subsequent functions rely on that function I'm dead in the water. I know that it's something small I need to change so minimal help is needed but unfortunately not available. Also, I did ask about it in the forum but no teacher replied and the two student replies didn't help...on to other training options.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Kwai K H•Dec 12, 2018super amazing and experienced teachers who know where students usually make errors from and offered valuable advice (such as correct as you go instead of delayed perfection) which I used to work on the datetime project at the end, without which I would get stuck and not know what to do.

I would strongly suggest that Coursera change its system of peer reviewing submitted assignments, because it leaves a lot of opportunities for negligence. I had two assignments where two of my three peers passed my submissions while a third individual would fail my work citing that I was missing components of the assignments that were actually present. This caused a lot of unnecessary stress due to concerns of whether or not there would be individuals still present, and willing, left in the course session to grade the assignment. I am aware that this is no fault of the instructor, but rather the platform the course is presented on, but this should not be the case.

The structure fits my learning needs, so I am totally content.One star is missing in my rating. I do miss some more grammar practices, which are not dependent on the current lesson. To me, it would be very helpful to do more excercises, where I have to tranfer the new skills to unknown sentences. However, you cannot match the interests of all learners, so I consider it not as a major issue.The parts in which Anna explains new grammar could be a little longer to help the knowledge to settle \"deeper in the brain\".Overall great job with just minor flaws in my view! Thanks for offering the course!StephanThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Kelly P•May 14, 2019This course was very helpful in continuing my Chinese studies. I loved the real life application of the lessons. The one thing I don't like is the peer review in order to pass the class. After doing this, it became clear to me that many people are on different levels in regards to their Chinese ability. I'm not sure a peer review is the best way to grade if someone did well in the class or not. Someone who has a very limited ability would find it difficult to properly grade someone with a much higher proficiency. It's very possible that people receive low scores due to others' lack of vocabulary, proper pronunciation, or grammar. While I think a peer review is okay, since I'm paying to complete the course, the least a professor could do is take the time to review my final submission and give me real feedback on what areas I need to improve in and what areas I'm strong in. That way I can know for sure that I'm receiving the grade I earned rather than a grade based off of another student's ability to understand. Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

      "89  -means-  or Positive Psychology: Character, Grit and Research MethodsFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Lisa A K•Jun 28, 2017This course is laid out poorly. It skips around too much. I would prefer a more concise approach: e.g. present Angela Duckworth's work in week one, then present research methods in weeks 2, how to read research reports in week 3, then offer the applications to research in Positive Psychology in week 4. The course loses the thread of Positive Psychology that is common to all the other courses in this specialization because of this scatter-shot approach to presenting the concepts. The order of course content and the readings (which are often too technical for the course objectives and redundant to the lectures) bog the student down. This course does have irony: It certainly takes grit to complete it.

This class is confusing and needs to decide exactly what it's trying to teach. Grit or research? If I had realized this certification required me to learn so much about research methodology and practice, I would not have paid money to take it. I'm learning about Positive Psychology for my own personal benefit, not because I want to do it for a living. A precursory overview of research (one day or week of class) would have been more than sufficient and wouldn't have left me wishing I hadn't registered for this class/certification. As for the videos about grit... this is really what I'd like to learn about, but the audio is terrible and the presentation aren't organized at all - it seems more like a randomly selected set of video segments pulled from the middle of unrelated lectures. They don't improve my understanding of grit or research at all.

The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.

      "103  -means-  or Essential Design Principles for TableauFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy Víctor M C•Aug 08, 2018A really poor course.I don't get how this Course is rated so high.There is a lot of chit-chat about Colors, Principles, and the use of lines. But Tableau contents are scarce and just scratched.  Don't be fooled with the \"Tableau\" word. Tableau is just anecdotal here.  There is a whole week where Tableau is not even shown during this course! Run away. Rename \"Essential Design Principles for Tableau\" to \"Essential Design Principles\" and the course would be fit much better.For those thinking about the Specialization:I'm doing the Specialization \"Data Visualization with Tableau\" and contents through the courses are soooo repetitive. First two courses done from 5 up to now. My review: If you sum all the videos, just barely 2 weeks, or even less, (from 8 weeks) are talking about Tableau! A Joke. Hands on? 4 times in 2 courses, and say thank you.The other 6 weeks repeats again and again how to use Colors, how to be Ethical with graphs, and several theoretical principles about how your Brain works. Cool for 1 week, but they have filled 7 weeks of such artifacts, repeating once and again the same videos from different povs. Again and again. Again and again. Sounds repetitive? Again and again. Even using same slides. I'm not here to teach me about \"perception\", \"colors\", and \"3d charts sucks for 2D charts\", or better said...it would be cool if you tell me ONCE. Not in each course, forgetting about why we're here: Tableau.Feel free to jump the first two courses.

Learners can feel the tangible benefit and knowledge of this course once they have taken it. Honour Tracks are an excellent way to challenge yourself to the core if you don't have a statistical background or a strong financial knowledge. I genuinely enjoyed the lectures and how the materials were distributed in an equal and light manner starting from knowing investor's types, how to allocate asset portfolios, types of investment techniques, and ending with how to choose your fund manager. My favourite parts was the least likely: the exams and quizzes parts. These were built in a way that educates and challenge to resolve and learn, but designed to be impossible. A profound pedagogical approach even in the quizzes and honour tracks. This course deserves nothing but the best rating. I recommend wholeheartedly.

      "105  -means-  or Fundamentals of Scalable Data ScienceFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Mike D•Nov 29, 2018Currently, it is not advisable to take this course.I have finished the excellent IBM Data Science Professional Certificate series on Coursera and wanted to improve my knowledge of scalable Data Science with this series. Unfortunately, the videos and advice are extensively outdated. Python 2 is used through this course and the instructions of how to set up Node-RED and Cloudant do not work. I have been trying to work myself around that but then again, I wouldn't need this course in the first place and it only leads to confusion. Also, instead of the Cloudant application UI, Kibana seems to be used now, which there is no introduction to.

The videos are referring to an outdated software releases, with really different screenshots from the ones existing on IBM platform. The discussions refers to code samples different from the ones available for download (flow2.js) and to applications present on the IBM Bluemix platform, without explaining where to found or how to create them. All these discrepancies make really difficult to follow the course. LBNL, the speaker is one of the most boring ever encountered in a webinar, barely able to read in english language. Being a course organized by IBM for such an important topic as Watson, I expected a much higher level of quality. I hope that the IBM staff will be able to perform a deep review of this series of course.

I would appreciate some more in depth practical/technical information about IoT, also about apache spark and the overall mechanism of action in the real world. The assignments I did not enjoy much, I found them rather uninteresting, although I appreciate the concept behind them and I can see why they were chosen.  I really appreciate Romeo - I find him very interesting and I can tell he has a lot of experience and passion for what he has been doing. This particular course could provide a lot more information and education on scalable data science. Overall I found it ok, but I do appreciate that this is a new subject area and people have trouble collating material together.

This guy can't even articulate himself. Please stop doing this to the user since now coursera started charging subscription fees.

You can say I'm being lenient with the review otherwise with the poor quality of forums I would give 2. 4 just for the professor's explanations. There are heavy mistakes in slides/ videos. Worst part is that the discussion forum is only filled with \"Please review my assignment\" instead of meaningful discussions. Peer review system has defeated the very purpose of discussion forums.

I liked very much how the order of subjects where build. However, if you allow me to give a *constructive* criticism, please let me say that the strategy chosen to ask lectures to read from previous written scripts, instead of letting them present more naturally, was a bad one. I understand that in order to make the legends/captions available, the lecturers kinda read from scripts their talks and this was very bad. It would be much better next time if you allow each speaker give the talk naturally as they want, with no reading, and then latter produce the subtitles. The lecturers are reseachers and not ACTORS so the final result of reading word by word what they were saying compromised a lot the final quality of their talks. Please don't get me wrong, I just trying to be constructive giving back somehow the time and effort spent by you guys to prepare such nice course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Horacio S•Mar 26, 2017Too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Amanda B•Aug 14, 2016This class' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course. The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop.

Я - семья - работа - обществоFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Valentina•Jun 27, 2019Поначалу показалось немного схоластичным. То есть сильно отличается от подачи в зарубежных университетах, где больше кейсов, каких- то жизненных примеров, разборов и анализов. Мне кажется этого часто недостает в нашей системе обучения. Но в целом я рада за Томский университет, они молодцы, что так продвинулись вперед и сделали такой курс! Я сама выпускница МГУ им. М.В. Ломоносова, и (насколько мне известно) наш университет не предложил пока онлайн обучение, хотя очень даже могли бы.Сейчас очень много встречается случаев, когда людей увольняют с работы спустя 3 месяца, и они недоумевают, почему? Почему команда такая неидеальная, почему так плохо работают?  У них начинаются конфликты, и в итоге уходят со всех работ. Думаю именно таким кадрам данный курс был бы очень даже применим. Еще бы неплохо было бы добавить в программу часть по нейромаркетингу или психологии, и ссылок на современные исследования. Так как я уже много изучила литературы по этой теме, и буду изучать еще, то именно этому курсу есть куда расти и развиваться.В целом тема конфликтов и стрессов  в особенности для России очень актуальна.

Useful as an intro to systems thinking, and as a way to understand the obesity epidemic in a nuanced way.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Dean P•Sep 02, 2018Great course! They explain greatly why obesity is a result that comes from complex socioeconomic systems. They also give you insight on how you can use software that can imitate such systems. By doing so, you can develop systems in your own comfort from your own PC and see the results. Truth is we need far more data and human systems are too complex, but this is a good initiative and we should pay attention to their findings! I hope in the near future to be part of a big system development that can bring clear results so that we can take definite action. My opinion is that we kinda know what to do, but some lobbies and established corporations are not changing their attitudw towards human public health and they keep sickening us.

I also appreciated that the more technical aspects, like using software, had been moved into Labs, which left space and time in the lectures to cover material relevant to the topic. I was surprised at the lack of interaction, though. I have no idea if there were more than a handful of other students nor if there was a support team since there was hardly any participating in the discussion forum. One technical question remained unanswered for example... It seems that there could be a lot of great discussion on the course material if more engagement were encouraged.

      "115  -means-  or Parallel programmingFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Kinshuk V•Dec 16, 2017Although the course is taught well and covers a lot of ground, it is my opinion that the course content is not relevant to what I and majority of other Scala developers were looking for in terms of parallel programming. The instructor has been upfront in differentiating parallel programming (the objective of this course) from concurrency programming. However, I was more interested in learning about concurrency, especially about Akka actors, etc. I wish there was a course of Akka, which is what most Scala developers use for concurrent applications.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Oliinyk V•Apr 02, 2018General idea of the course is very good. There are a few things to improve though:Focus more on intuition behind algorithms rather than formal mathBuild a solid foundation that would allow students to develop parallel algorithms themselves.  Practical assignments should focus exactly on this, rather than filling in missing pieces of code that are only tangentially related to the algorithm itself. It would be helpful if the course provided minimal but solid basics and intuition behind parallel computations. The basics that would allow students to learn more advanced concepts themselves.In any case, the course has a lot of value and the instructors are awesome.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy VICTOR A•Aug 11, 2018All but the last assignment are interesting. A fair amount of the lectures are also good, even though some of them are too theoretical - the bad lectures are the ones that focus too much into proving mathematical properties, but thankfully there is just a few of those.The last assignment is considerably larger than the other ones and requires a physics background (or interest to do research on your own). I think they could improve it by approaching the material independently with smaller exercises before applying them again into the larger application that is built as part of the assignment today.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Šejla Č•Mar 08, 2019Plus: Very in-depth lectures, challenging assignments. Minus: The actual parallel code somewhat remains a black-box, assignments sometimes focus more on figuring out the algorithm logic which may not have anything to do with the course. Still I enjoyed it and learned a great deal.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Leitner C S E S•Nov 21, 2017Some of the practical examples are a bit tedious, because the bigger issues you sometimes need to solve seem to be implementing a random algorithm, instead of implementing its parallelization per se. That is, the support classes for parallelizing the algorithms are pre-coded for you, while you at times spend more time figuring out how the algorithm itself needs to be implemented with that rather than coming up with these parallelization semaphores (which I would have considered more interesting, at least). But the content covered is highly relevant and first class (the authors being world-leading experts on the topic), so if you are interested in parallel programming, this is course is a great choice.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Marcin Z•Apr 16, 2019First 3 weeks were cool, but the last week was somehow rushed and the assignment did not involve any parallel programming.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Ilya B•Jan 20, 2019The tasks are not well designed for online educationThumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Denys L•Dec 10, 2018Nice and complicatedThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Christoph K•Nov 27, 2018Very interesting material, especially the prefix sum algorithms about, how to transform a sequential problem into a parallel problem.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Bruno M•Dec 03, 2018Very good introductory theoretical foundation for parallell algorithms, and background for \n",

Without unnecessary fillers or constant interruptions from quizzes, it's easy to stay focused on the learning. The two peer-graded assignments make sure that the knowledge has sunk in without it being necessary to quiz the students incessantly, as is the case with many other courses here. Although the course is broken up into 6 weeks, it can actually be completed much faster, as the different weeks merely show an overview of the different topics to which they're devoted. Even so, the materials contained within each week do have some depth and are a perfect starting point for people who would like to learn more about depression.

Лектор читает его весьма понятном и доходчивым способом. Наверно самым сложным местом для понимания был раздел международной торговли. Я начал этот курс в качестве параллельного изучения предмета вместе с прослушиванием лекций в Высшей Школе экономики в ИППС. В Лекциях Замулина давалось много того, что не рассказывалось на очных лекциях. Мне это понравилось. Но также в лекциях Замулина упущено много того, что рассказывалось нам на очных лекциях. Например, раздел, связанный с равновесием производства и финансового рынка (MS и LM кривые). Этот раздел я бы очень хотел видеть в лекциях на Coursera, поскольку использование их часто помогает довольно легко отслеживать взаимосвязи между макроэкономическими явлениями.Вышесказанная рекомендация никак не влияет на мою оценку курса и лектора, которых я советую к изучению, в случае необходимости знакомства с основами макроэкономики.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Ekaterina B•Dec 10, 2016Очень полезный курс!

Machine learning is fascinating and I now feel like I have a good foundation.  A few minor comments: some of the projects had too much helper code where the student only needed to fill in a portion of the algorithm.  I would have preferred to have worked through more of the code. Also, there were a few times when the slides didn't contain the complete equations so it was difficult to piece it all together when writing the code.  Lastly, I wish that there was more coverage on vectorized solutions for the algorithms.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (77)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Murali N•Jun 15, 2016Excellent starting course on machine learning.

Because i feel like this is where most people slip up in practice.Great thanks for all of that!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (45)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Deleted A•Mar 18, 2017This is an extremely basic course. Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized. So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.g. elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (34)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Pooritat T•Sep 01, 2018Sub title should be corrected.

I took the course in 2019 when it had been around for a few years and so what I am saying here may resonate with a lot of people who have taken the course before me. \"Concretely\"(!), Prof Ng takes the student on a very well structured journey that covers the vast canvas of ML, explaining not just the theoretical aspects but also laying equal empahsis on the pratical aspets like debugging or choosing the right approach to solving a ML problem or deciding what to do first / next. At that level this course is highly recomended by me as the first course in ML that anyone should take. I do have a suggestion to make regarding how some of the portions could have been explained more lucidly. These are portions that pertain entirely to the mathematics and programming problems, where I struggled for days and (for back propogation) for months before realising that maybe the explanation given in the slide wasn't clear enough and at times i just needed to try really random ideas to get out of the programmin rut that I was stuck in. An advise for anyone doing the course would be to write down the matrices in full detail and do the transformations of cost fucntion and gradient descent or back prop using pen and paper and attempt to write the code for it only after once one is clear about the exact mathematical operation happening. Thank you, Prof Ng for gifting this course to the online learners community and I would also like to thank the mentors who have replied to the queries patiently while stadfastly enforcing the honour code.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (16)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Имильбаев Р Р•Dec 25, 2018It would be ideal course if instead of octave pyhon or r is usedThumbs UpThis is helpful (14)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Olga K•Apr 18, 2018You need to know, what do you want to get out of this course.

The biggest issue I had was the disconnect between the course and the assignments/quizzes.  Although they had help sections, because you couldn't ask direct questions about the algorithms/quizzes, if you had a problem, you were basically on your own. (At least that is what it felt like.)  For example, if you missed a quiz question and couldn't figure out the answer, there seemed little recourse to find the actual answer.

      "136  -means-  r Python Data VisualizationFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Kilambi B•Jun 06, 2019The course has been well structured and the assignments are quite challenging which means you would definitely be spending your time on stackoverflow/google but this is how one can learn to code. It's difficult to trach each and every detail. However, couple suggestions i can make -1.) It took a very long time to understand the problem statements in the projects. It would be great if more information is provided on what is the exact input and expected output (instead of being verbose if an example function call is given it would be more helpful). 2.) The code i had written for the assignments even though they work i wasnt sure if they are optimized enough. If any inputs are provided on this it would be good to compare our code with the optimized one and can improve our skills further. Overall a very informative course. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to master the basics of python data structures and their manipulation.

The videos cover (very) basic material and you end up spending the majority of your time in the specialization on STACK_OVERFLOW.  There are no examples of what's expected for output of projects and you are at the mercy of the computer grader to try to figure out why your code doesn't work -- a lot of time despite what appears to be the correct output at your terminal.  And the discussion forums are trolled by the students -- and probably the mentors -- but it may take 7 - 10 days to get a response to a question -- of any response at all.  And to be honest, the few responses I received were in the realm of \"This is so easy, why don't you understand it?!\"  And there is no final -- or instructor generated code -- to compare to yours at the end of each project to get some feedback on how you're coming as a coder.  Overall, a frustrating experience that honestly could be made better if some examples of input and final code were provided for the projects.  This is NOT for the beginning coder w/o some Python experience.  Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Abdurrachman•Apr 20, 2018Not interestingThumbs UpThis is helpful \n",
      "137  -means-   for Functional Programming Principles in ScalaFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Vladimir P•Sep 14, 2018It took me much longer than expected to finish the course and sometimes it made me feel stupid and helpless. Diving into functional programming was a mind bending experience, totally worth time spent!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Tom Y•Dec 27, 2018The course was quite good all in all, and even though I'm already experienced with many of the aspects involved in software engineering in general and in functional programming in particular, I've followed it with much interest and gained some new perspectives. And it's been a great introduction to Scala (a language I had not written code in before).The teaching is very good! Prof Odersky's explanations are very clear and go into the right level of detail, and the exercises and assignments are interesting and seem to be well thought out.I personally would have liked the course to be deeper, both in explaining functional programming (e.g. the monad pattern) and in covering more advanced features of Scala (e.g. the less trivial parts of the type system), but I guess the given course is OK as an introduction and I can also go look for the stuff I'm missing in other courses and/or outside Coursera.Two minor things that damaged the experience to a little extent and which I would recommend to improve for the future: 1. The technical introduction was good enough to get me started, but did not cover some problematic aspects which had me stuck for a long while (it was also very difficult to solve by googling, and a colleague of mine - who's also taking the course - ended up solving it by chance). Specifically I'm talking about worksheets not working properly unless created within a package directory, and for some things unless set to a certain mode of execution (non-REPL). Disclosure: I haven't looked for solutions in the course forums; it's possible that this was asked and answered, or that I could have asked and gotten an answer there. 2. The videos were poorly edited: some bits repeated, some clips were obviously recorded for a specific week number but then given in another week, some parts had obviously been there originally (and other parts referred to them) but then they didn't make the final cut... It's a pity that an otherwise very well made course suffers from such small technical problems, which, while not too grave, cause confusion and increase the mental load the learner has to cope with - which is already laden with challenging stuff - with such non-important and easily avoidable distractions.Thank you!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Pere M B•Jan 06, 2019Really well explained, with thoughtful examples and labs that make your brain actually comprehend all the lessons.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy David F•Jan 14, 2019The course in general is kind of theoretical. Some of the homeworks are fairly challenging. I found it a useful companion to the Programming in Scala book, which I'm working through at the moment.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Scott L•Jun 04, 2016I am a statistician who works primarily with R, with some Python for the things Python is better for.  I know how to program, but I explicitly note I am not a computer science student. I have only limited experience with the command prompt. I was very excited when I heard about this course, but the amount of work and frustration just to get started programming in Scala has been obscene. I am very, very glad I decided to check out the course for free before paying for the specialization.The course has a lot of required software. The tutorials to get this software often involve \"You need this, but so save time we're going to skip showing you how to get it. If it doesn't work, you need to install it.\" There is a lot of variability in OSs. Many errors are often encountered. There is no help. Among the things the course requires are two (three?) IDEs for Scala (I note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of IDE... but you need IntelliJ, and Eclipse to submit...). The guides show how to get started on a Mac. The software is not the same on Windows, and so 'step by step instructions' become a guessing game, because many options or menus are missing or different. There are many better and more friendly guides on the internet. I may return to the transcripts of the course content here, but I won't be submitting any coursework. I'm going to warn my colleagues away as well. Forget Coursera - I'll just buy a book and work through it like everyone else I know. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Joe H•Sep 05, 2018Generally excellent! Reading around other online introductory resources the difference in clarity from the creator of the language, Martin Odersky in this course is very clear. I feel I have a good base to continue my learning from. To make it even better as an introduction I would have liked 3 things. Firstly more examples and exercises. along with the more challenging ones, more correct vs incorrect examples exercises, to reinforce the theoretical understanding that is so clearly present. This would translate more quickly into practical coding skills.  Secondly some more tips on the development environment, specifically how to get the debugging tools working. Lastly, updating the code base to the lastest versions of Scala and SBT, so there are no deprecation warnings when building. Having said all that, I'm really happy to have found this course and excited now I've completed it to continue my learning of Scala.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Aneesh D•Sep 23, 2017A great course. Functional programming really is a different way of thinking about programming and this course does justice to all of its core concepts. The assignments are very well structured and teach all the best practices of the paradigm.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Diego•Sep 29, 2017Very interesting course, it totally changes your mindset from imperative programming. Basically it teaches you to think in terms of recursion instead of loops. Although some assignments can be difficult (and take several hours), they are helpful to understand the concepts and challenging as well so they keep you engaged to the course. Besides, the lectures are very clear and designed to give some hints on the assignments. Since Scala is based in Java, previous knowledge of Java is an advantage, but not a must. However, previous programming knowledge is a must in my opinion.All in all, a very recommendable course to take.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Darren B•Aug 13, 2017This course helped me significantly.  There is very little in the way of AFFORDABLE Scala Education out there.  This is a problem.  There are endless educational resources for Python.  Scala has a lot to offer programmers if only they knew where to find adequate educational Resources for Scala.Make learning Scala easy enough for a 12 year old to learn and you will see it explode.  Make Scala, Easy !  Make Scala, Fun !  This is essential to opening the young minds interested in Computer Programming. Also!Why isn't there a native Graphic Scala Lib like Python's Tkinter?Not everybody wants to be a \"Big Data\" Mining Engineer.If Scala can produce graphics from the Java Swing library and experimental ScalaFX graphics lib, then isn't it time for Scala to have it's own native Graphic Library that is at the least as capable as Tkinter for Python.There is no better feeling than the liberating emotion you get from creating programs, games and Apps on your own PC.

      "141  -means-  r ООП и паттерны проектирования в PythonFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy Roman B•Aug 28, 2018TL;DR не рекомендую.Из трех пройденных курсов специализации это самый слабый и спорный.Начинается он с задорного рассказа про \"профессионализм\", \"культуру программирования\" и \"чистый код\", в котором слушателям предлагается краткий пересказ идей, изложенных в замечательных книгах Макконнелла и Мартина, а заканчивается финальным проектом, заготовка которого представляет из себя какое-то месиво с жесткими зависимостями, глобальными переменными, смешением ответственности а классах, несоблюдением pep-8,  а в папке с проектом даже нет файлика requirements.txt, чтобы сразу поставить все нужные пакеты. Очень культурно и профессионально.А вообще я бы не сказал, что этот курс про ООП и паттерны проектирования в Python, он скорее про ООП и паттерны проектирования без привязки к языку, потому что про чисто питонячьи штуки в нем как-то особо и не говорят. Может быть у меня склероз, но я не помню, чтобы в курсе рассказывали о декораторе @property, или напомнили про дескрипторы и метаклассы. А вот что в сниппетах и каких-то ДЗ попадались самые настоящие геттеры и сеттеры помню. Вроде как-то не очень pythonic.Сами же паттерны даны... Ну даны как есть, наверное не лучше и не хуже чем в других источниках по паттернам. Есть некая адаптация пот питон абстрактной фабрики, но на мой взгляд какая-то она подозрительная. Такое ощущение, что она хоть на первый взгляд и выглядит прикольно, в конце концов приведет в дублированию кода или странным схемам наследования. Но тут я могу быть не прав, просто \"меня терзают смутные сомнения\" по предложенной реализации.Также я наслышан о борьбе студентов с грейдером в попытках сдать домашние задания, и неинформативности выдаваемых ошибок, но, по правде говоря, лично с этим столкнулся только один раз за весь курс.Если создатели курса будут это читать, то я прошу их не обижаться за резкие слова и плохую оценку, я не хейтер или какой-то злобный тролль, первому курсу специализации я написал отзыв с пятью звездами, третьему еще напишу хороший отзыв, а здесь пока вот так, увы. Надеюсь кураторы специализации и преподаватели приложат усилия и переработают курс, чтобы его уровень соответствовал уровню других курсов в специализации.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (37)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Vilensky D•Jan 10, 2019Курс - сырой.

В некоторых кусках исходного кода для задач присутствуют явные ошибки и опечатки, условия местами очень размытые, так что приходится догадываться о том, что именно хотели от слушателя, в лучшем случае по ответам грейдера. Особенно неприятно удивило предложение в задании переопределить для вектора на плоскости метод __len__ для возврата его длины (которая является действительным числом), что приводит к неработоспособности данного метода из-за встроенных в Python ограничений  на тип возвращаемого значения. Вводить код для выполнения задания в онлайн-форму на сайте очень неудобно (один раз эта чудо-система вообще ухитрилась начать молча игнорировать все изменения в коде и отправлять на проверку одну и ту же некорректную версию), в лучшем случае приходится писать код у себя в файле, а потом копировать его содержимое в форму.

Неужели вы думаете, что большая часть людей использует в своей ежедневной работе ряд Фибоначчи ? преподаватели курса - преподаватели МФТИ.После прослушивания курса становится понятно почему у нас из ВУЗа выходят люди абсолютно не приспособленные к жизни - проблема в том, что их грузят знаниями, которые к реальности не имеют никакого отношения. Если не знаете как сделать полезный для практического применения курс - купите какой-нибудь коммерческий курс составленный практиками, а не такими же как вы теоретиками из ВУЗа и используйте его как пример (хотя бы послушайте как в Гарварде преподают лекции - это же как настоящая захватывающая история, которую просто интересно  прослушать, а не то что учиться).

This whole unit needs some MAJOR updating.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Hannah B•Dec 14, 2015Unfortunately I found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization. I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling. I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds. A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely. In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all. I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization. I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners. Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Fernando B G•Nov 13, 2017Classes are not fluid, did not learn much at all,  very different in relation to Scott classes.

I've been struggling with where to begin (should I take a course on Python? R? What languages are even useful? WTF is cloud computing?) And this course gave me a good starting off point. That said, it wasn't technical AT ALL. It's really just a bunch of \"fireside chats\" with data scientists, talking about the languages they use, what concepts they're used for, what knowledge is necessary and what isn't, etc. If you're looking for a \"roadmap\" to continue learning on Coursera, this is it. This is exactly what I feel the college experience gives students that online or self-taught learning lacks: context. AKA there are a billion courses on Python on Coursera, but none explain WHY I'm learning Python. This course does that.

I did not enjoy seeing the young data scientists talking about their jobs.  I was not too impressed by Dr. Haider or the professor from NYU.  Dr. Haider misused some words, such as \"judgmental\" and \"argumentative\".  Without any evidence or examples for support, he claimed that it was more important for a job applicant to have a sense of humor than technical skills.This course should have named specific techniques used in data science, and how to acquire the knowledge.   Regression was mentioned, but the explanation was inadequate.  Perhaps the explanation should have been omitted.  K-nearest neighbor was mentioned.  Many students want to know what courses to take next, what computer languages to study, etc.  What are the computer programming languages of the future?Students cannot learn everything.  Would it make sense for someone to skip some things, and to focus on others?  Should everyone learn Python?  Does everyone need to learn SQL?  What about Tableau?  Is that worthless? How should students set their learning priorities in order to achieve a basic or minimal skill set within 3 or 6 or 12 months?Remember that most Coursera students already have a college degree.The course was created several years ago, so I think it needs to be updated regarding developments of the last three years.

      "148  -means-  or Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep LearningFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Ben B•Mar 17, 2019This felt like a glorified tutorial for TensorFlow/Keras. I expected more in-depth treatment of the material. E.g. covering more ground (regularization wasn't mentioned at all), or going into more depth on the machine learning theory (why are we using this activation function, this loss, or this optimiser) or practical tips (e.g. discussions of network design) or the tools we are using (e.g. what exactly is TensorFlow, what is Keras, how do they relate to each other, how do they work under the hood).I also raised some issues and PRs on the github repo for the worksheets to correct problems in some of the worksheets, but these were not responded to by the time I had finished the course over a week later, despite the low volume of issues and PRs on that repo.I paid for the course upon getting to the first quiz so that I could have my answers graded, but I don't feel that I got my money's worth.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (35)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Kristina P•Mar 14, 2019I was expecting a more elaborate content and graded programming exercises for those who pay for the course. Instead the major part of the content is based on the  FREE tutorials available on TensorFlow website. Besides, the course is split to 4 weeks but the complexity of the content does not fit to the announced period. It can be easily completed within few days or less by any avearage CV researcher. It is populated with a bunch of very short videos with 'surface scratching' explanations.  A targeted learner seems to be an undegrad.  Also, some important concepts of TensorFlow were not explained (ex: what is tensor? etc.)  Overall, I am disappointed and consider this a waste of money. eventhough, it can be useful as an audit for those who need some structure in self-education as it provides the sequence of tasks and some quizes as many other courses by Coursera. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (25)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy David T•Mar 11, 2019I like the CoLab Intro, and basics of Keras.  But I think the 1st course are a bit too basic for someone who took the 5 courses Deep Learning Specialization.  And it is too fast for someone who had not taken the DL courses.   I would like the instructors to go over these topics in future courses: 1) TensorBoard and how to debug a faulty model2) TF 2.0 features (Eager execution, etc)  3) hands on example on how to fix the model if validation accuracy is much worse than training accuracy 4) LSTM models 5) how to productionize the model for real life use, like TF edge or TF.jsThumbs UpThis is helpful (18)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Charles•Apr 28, 2019Far too basic - almost nothing about Tensorflow - graphs, tensors, estimators, tf.data, etc. The course is a bunch of pre-built examples using the Keras APIs to hit run on in Google collab. This is a very gentle introduction to Keras APIs, with no discussion of what's actually happening with Tensorflow.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (15)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Mark B•Mar 09, 2019Often coursera courses are a bit easy / superficial. This course is a bit too much so. There's just not enough meat-on-the-bone for my liking. The instructor came across very well, the material is polished and professional, there's just not enough material for me to think of this as being a course. It only takes about an hour to do each weeks' material; the programming examples provide almost no challenge. As a first course on the topic this might be okay, but if you've done anything in this space before then it will be too easy. The course also uses the highest-level TensorFlow APIs; in a sense I wonder if this is really about TensorFlow when that same API is usable with other frameworks. I hope the rest of the specialisation has more detail.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (8)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Raul D M•Apr 14, 2019Even if this course it is an introduction to TensoFlow, it is too easy.

Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Olivier D•Aug 02, 2019This course barely touches what Tensorflow is and how it works, it is just a very basic introduction to Keras, and most of the time is spent explaining machine learning concepts rather than Tensorflow ones.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Irina G•Aug 02, 2019I've finished the whole specialization in one week with 100% on all quizzes. I returned to its first course to rate it one star. I would give it 4 stars if the whole specialization was put in one free course \"Shallow intro to TensorFlow with non-working and uninspiring examples\". The intros with A.Ng are promising, big words and ideas, but the videos and examples are simplistic and don't deliver. There is no much work to do on this specialization, and I developed skepticism and mistrust toward the instructor. He doesn't come across as an experienced ML/TF practitioner, and some of his discussions are intentionally vague. It's incomparable in depth and content to Deep Learning specialization from the same deeplearning.ai.  It also dilutes the value of Coursera's Specialization.  Please redo.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Fengjun W•Aug 18, 2019Finally, wasted my weekend and 40 euros to finish this specialization.  I really dont know the target audience of this specialization.  If you have no background of deep learning, going through some code snippets without any explanation wont help you at all. you  can't know anything behind it. If you already have some knowledge, you will find nothing new and more in this course. 1) The materials are so shallow and without any depth, just reading the slides and codes with errors. Only some high-level Keras APIs are covered. The official Tensorflow tutorial is much better. 2) The test questions are of no value at all, it cant test any your understanding whether about deep learning or the tool Tensorflow. The assignments are poorly designed, the answers contain errors. 3) I strongly doubt the instructor, I think he does not have much ML experience.  Please don't waste your money and time on this specialization. If you want to learn deep learning, go to cs230; cs231n for computer vision; cs224n and cs224u for NLP; cs20 for Tensorflow.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Oleg P•Apr 08, 2019Really disappointed.

If you have knowledge in Deep Learning you can earn this certificate within a few hours just by answering the (rather simple) quizzes even without watching the videos because the programming assignments are not graded.

I did need to revisit sections in each week to ensure I understood what was taught well enough. Each of the faculty had a unique style and the time-travel (sort of) into the history of computing in particular was a fascinating if short section--I had no idea Illinois UC was such a storied campus.

I think Professor Schaub is a good lecturer and presents the information well.  The bad: There is no faculty (professor or TA) support. There are some discussions in the forums, but not a whole lot of direction. Also, with the course setup this way, peer review becomes very difficult, because there is no guarantee that there are enough peers to review (and be reviewed). There are also many typos in the quizzes so it's difficult to know if an answer is truly wrong. Finally, the simulation questions can be infuriating because the same codebase can work for one but not the other, and with no support, it's difficult to determine the issue. Still, the content is great and you learn a lot.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)\n",

The story was all here, buried! The story just took very careful excavation with archeology tools and ah-ha moments, like when Professor Nigro understood the connection of the Youth of Motya to Troy based on an inscription on a bowl!  Wow!  I am fascinated by the connection of the Sacred Pool to astronomy.  I am horrified by the implications of the Tophet.  I wonder if the tophet ritual was a form of birth control on an island of limited space.  This course changed my view of the origins of civilization, not just all Greek and Egyptian, by Near-East and Phoenician.  Each class was a mind-changer! I could still use more understanding of what life was like in the busy city - a day in the life of the many types of people there.

The grading process it self is a bit difficult as each question is sort of a good or bad options only , there is no room to provide a more refined assessment such as yes main elements were provided but failed to fully answer the question and deserve a 3/4 grade but choice is only 0/4 or 4/4. The feedback we get from the graded activities is therefore limited.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Hernán O•Dec 26, 2018Excelent!Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Ekemini O•Feb 01, 2019I have enjoyed every bit of this course.

In particular, in lessons 2 and 3 all \"topic  introductions\" could be joined with the following \"let's discuss this topic inside a DAW\" video.Awful dynamic range. In some videos voice of lector is very quiet (-20 dB or less) and sound played from the DAW is much louder (around -6 dB). In other videos, the opposite: loud lector and quiet DAW. Change of microphone setup between intro video and \"in the DAW\" video is also very noticeable and distracting.Repeats of repeats over repeats. This is not needed at all. I could repeat everything by myself, just pause video and replay interesting fragment. I don't need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track. Yes, It should be done from time to time, but not each time. These repeats make the lessons unnecessary long, it feels I could have been told the same information in half of time or less.This combines with very slow pace of a lector. I listened all lessons on 1.5 or even 2.0 tempo, just to not fall asleep.Quizzes are strange. Stupid quesion appeared in quiz three: which key combinations we use in the videos? But why do you ever ask this, how this relates to the topic? I use another DAW in another OS, I even don't have a \"command\" key, I could have changed my hot keys, so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me. I was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune, how it sounds and alike, not this particular crap. Trust me, anyone could figure which hot keys to use. I am not just a monkey, I have an ability to explore my software by myself, I don't need to be told how to copy and paste, and even if I need this I just go look in the manual.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Karl D•Feb 01, 2019Excellent course!!Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Mahmoud H•Feb 06, 2019Perfect, i do recommend it.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Anerson E•Nov 26, 2018This course was really fun, I have learned so much.

The videos are focused and structured which make each concept easy to digest for the student. In-depth focus on stacking and doubling vocals is really well done and thoroughly explained. Could not think of a better way to organize and teach the Filtering, Delay, Reverb and more exotic FX like Vocoder and Talk Box. I have been producing R&B, Jazz and Gospel style vocals for artists, including some on Def Jam, Jive, Universal Records, using these very techniques that we pioneered and learned in the studio setting back in the 90's. It is great to see an organized, structured presentation of these topics in an academic setting that retains all of the practicality of real-world vocal production.

Prince Charles Alexander is a multi-Grammy winning vocal mixer and producer. This course will greatly help those of us, like me, producing pop vocals. From here, students can explore pop vocal strategies in their future songs, using these ideas to think from.I would only recommend that prince Charles Alexander's impressive credentials be featured more prominently in the introduction and course name, that the week 2 quiz be a little more relevant and harder, and that students should seek out techniques to bring out the best vocal production. A great vocal production starts with a great performance, not covered in this short class.Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

Excellent Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Sandra S•Apr 17, 2018I would like to see Dr.Barber give a course in her fields of expertise, poetry and fictional literature, not in historical fields she doesn't understand. Historical research is a meticulous regimen. In pursuing the Shakespeare Authorship Question, Dr. Barber not only bypassed the history of the original authorship questions, she completely repeated the first questioners' mistakes, and continues down the paths of old dried-up ideas that lead nowhere. There have been legitimate and truly possible answers  to the SAQ over the past century, developed by professional historical research. Co-authors of Shakespeare's plays, both definitely identified and quite possible, have been named. In this course these real possibilities are ignored in favor of unsubstantiated romances with the rich and famous. The SAQ arguments today aren't debatable arguments at all - they are complaints which can be summed up in these few words: \"We are not being taken seriously.\" Dr. Barber's course has proven, once again, there is a good reason for that lack of acceptance. The only thing I received from this course was conversation with a very few participants who know how to ask questions and not insist that their favorite answers be the right ones. That was refreshing. But the course itself was stale, useless, and nothing I can recommend to anyone. Not even those who really, really want their favorite answers to the questions to be true. They've already been through all this before.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Deleted A•Mar 08, 2018Only because it won't accept a minus figure :-)Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Mike •Apr 29, 2018Beginning with a lecture on Confirmation Bias was a brave way to start this course. Attributing the reasons behind people's enthusiasms to confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance is a comfortable way for contrarians to convince themselves that outrageous contradictions of accepted scholarship and buccaneering interpretations of the historical record are not intrinsically ridiculous. In the 1990s, a group of mathematicians made a small fortune (they were caught early) by betting on the odds of a Hole in One in major golf tournaments. Unwary bookmakers would offer 500:1 or even 1000:1 when the actual odds were close to evens.A hole in one seemed much more unlikely than it actually was from thousands of tees shots played by hundreds of the best golfers in the world. Fans of the Authorship question try the same trick. Over and over and over. Only without the solid mathematical support. Each time a new tidbit appears—Weever's epigram, Sogliardo's identity, New Place malt stocks, Hampton Court as Avon, the Droueshout sleeves, suggestive numerology, the apparent solution of abstruse codes— articles are written about the \"discovery\" and websites filled with comment, support and argument. Yet amongst all the encyclopaedias of hopeful assertion, there is still no hard evidence supporting any alternative candidate. If there were, it would certainly have appeared in a four week attempt to legitimise doubt over Shakespeare's authorship—but check back. There is none. Nothing.There is no point in assessing the strength of the case for Shakespeare based on these materials. Dr Barber did not invite anyone to make it and could not have delivered a more feeble effort to make it herself. Items of evidence for Shakespeare are either challenged by the presentation of suggestive minutiae (rather than examined in their context) or waved away as part of a conspiracy to confuse and conceal the truth from everyone not possessed of the true eye for suggestive detail. Improbably, this includes almost everyone who studies and writes about Shakespeare (or ever has). Confirmation bias at work is the implication.Attributing significance to the insignificant is the business of the anti-Shakespearean. Arranging collections of suggestive nuggets in curiosity-inducing albums is the Art of the Doubter. \"Oh look!\" cries Barber, \"I've found another Marian Hacket. Doubt!!\"  Then \"Another Thomas Russell! Doubt!\" and \"a Warwickshire word in use in Newcastle! Doubt!\". The doubt discussed in this MOOC is entirely created by of the tutors, who foster it with selective misinterpretation of the historical record, false parallelisms, wildly imaginative interpretations of contemporary references, and serious abuse of probability theory, all of which you will find in Dr Barber's modules.The activity doesn't damage the case for Shakespeare. In examining anti-Shakespearean method using this type of doubter methodology, the learning opportunities on this course lie entirely in the study of how irrational people think.

Dr QuincyThumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Katrina D•Oct 26, 2018This was a fantastic course by Dr Ros Barber that was academically rigorous and exceedingly well-balanced, with plenty of extra material including incisive and incredibly detailed video interviews with Peter Dawkins, Mark Rylance, Professor William Leahy, Alexander Waugh and others. As someone who'd previously only been able to pursue research on this subject independently, including primary and secondary text sources, and even YouTube videos about the authorship question (including the excellent Shakespeare Authorship Trust SAT conference videos), being able to study this in an academic context gave me the assurance of what I already knew as well as, crucially, significantly expanding and deepening that knowledge. I feel it's absolutely crucial that many more people are able to learn from this course and discover this amazing subject. Exploring the issues of authorship can only enrich our knowledge of the plays, the period and the author, and has immediate relevance for our current times as well in so many areas. I also hope that there is the possibility of following up this introduction with further courses exploring the many illuminating academic strands of research that continue into the authorship question.

I think there should be more indications of the time that some material was first mooted  - e.g. so and so said this in, say, 1889 and then an indication that research has moved on since (or. tell the student where it hasn't). i think the course should start with the incumbent and then chip away from there.

The course information is inaccurate.  It states >Through forensic exploration of key texts, by both Shakespeare and other writers of the period, you will learn why Shakespeare’s authorship is questioned, and what evidence is cited on both sides of the debate<. That is totally untrue, no Shakespeare texts at all are examined and a one-sided account of the debate is presented, that ignores well-established documentary evidence to the contrary. The quizzes are very badly designed and the scholarly standard deplorable. As another learner says below: >To be blunt this course is so far from unacceptable to a university standard, it is absolutely shocking<!\n",

      "Sent from my iPadThumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Philip B•Mar 19, 2018The description of this course states that it “explores critical thinking, and the interpretation of texts, through the Shakespeare authorship question. Using doubt about Shakespeare’s authorship as our playground, we will explore the key concept of authorship attribution, while developing skills in literary analysis, interpretation, and argument. Through forensic exploration of key texts, by both Shakespeare and other writers of the period, you will learn why Shakespeare’s authorship is questioned, and what evidence is cited on both sides of the debate.”The course failed based on its stated goals.  -- There was little exploration of critical thinking.  Instead, a brief introduction to pop psychology warned against bias and the effects of cognitive dissonance.  -- The “skill development” took the form of stating certain rules for interpreting historical evidence.  But there was no effort made to actually cover the historical method; one of the rules that was discussed is entirely unsupported by any historical authority; the one scholar named in the lecture, when contacted, strongly disagreed with the spin placed on his words.  -- The discussion of evidence on both sides took the form generally of setting up strawman arguments on the side of Shakespeare’s authorship for the purpose of knocking them down.  Often the pro-Shakespeare arguments were taken out of context or given strained and illogical interpretations. -- For instance, the lecturer devoted a quarter of the first module (A.3.) to a discussion of “the broker theory.”  The idea was that, though Shakespeare was repeatedly named as a “player” in contemporary records and cast lists, he was really a “play-broker” who bought and sold plays, but neither wrote nor performed them.  Nobody at the time was described as a “play-broker,” nor is there evidence that describing someone as a player really meant that the person was a “play-broker.”  This entire line of discussion was apparently developed in order to identify Shakespeare as the target of a derisive poem that referred to “brokage” -- a word that meant something quite different from “brokerage” in the seventeenth century.The instructor was quite clear that this course was intended to promote the fringe belief that a Shakespeare’s authorship of the plays and poems is seriously questioned.  Though the description suggests that an even-handed approach would be observed, the lecturer chose to mispronounce Shakespeare’s name to distinguish the author from the man from Stratford; the comment section of the course was carefully scrubbed of pro-Shakespeare comments and even comments that complained about the quality of the course and materials -- in violation of the policies of Coursera.   Overall, this was a poorly organized, inadequately researched mess.  The lecturer has no academic credentials in the area, and was frequently corrected by course participants who had a better grasp of the material.  My recommendation is to drop this course entirely and start over, or just give it up.  Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Deleted A•Mar 01, 2018I've decided to discontinue my participation in the course, \"Introduction to Who Wrote Shakespeare\" conducted by Ros Barber.  My reasons are that the course is too sloppily prepared.  The typographical errors within the transcripts is extraordinarily high indicating that no one with authoritative knowledge has even read them, let alone proofread them.  Entire transcripts don't even match the video at all.    Class discussions posts are deleted for the pettiest of reasons.  Threads attempting to find answers to some of this errors  are locked for no valid reason.In short this course is a massive disappointment for me.The quizzes are too cryptic for me and the admitted error combined with all the transcription errors is just too much as it's just too difficult to sort it all out.I'm a graduate in Music History from the University of Colorado, have 60 college hours beyond that, and 34 years of teaching experience and can say with absolute certainty that the pedagogical methodology of this course is abysmally substandard.To be blunt this course is so far from unacceptable to a university standard, it is absolutely shocking.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Lexi O•Jan 03, 2019It's a good course for beginners and you get to know new things.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Raquel V•Feb 28, 2019Critical thinking is modeled while examining the evidence in favor and agaist the authorship doubt regarding  the  Shakespeare's plays.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Andrea C•Dec 27, 2018The course is very well organized and all the contents are extremely well structured!

In a new course there are always room for improvement, and staff responds quickly on feedback. I've been aware and interested in the subject for ten years, and always tried to be balanced and equally hard when examining evidence and interpretations. This course starts with reminding us to be conscious of the human tendency to see and explain facts so it's fits our existing view. In my view, it continues in this cautious manner, often reminding us students to be careful about conclusions. I understand some Stratfordians might see the course as biased, but we must remember the subject is about the possibilities for non-Stratfordian answers. I also think the facts almost always is presented in a balanced and neutral way, and I have during the course preferred Stratfordian explanations sometimes and non-Stratfordian sometimes. I've also been encouraged to read deeper than ever in the texts and find I'm closer to them than ever. I find the videos very well structured and very clearly presented.

This course will not only take you to a better understanding of the subject, but point you to constructive and positive methods of looking at all subjects.  I was particularly impressed with Dr. Barbur's initial framing of the topic, acknowledging its difficulties, and urging open minds and a rigorous thinking process.

After a week I can come up with two-handed chords and comp with a singer or a soloist (after some prep right now). I found the various options for improvising to be very informative. I enjoy the teacher very much, he is enthusiastic and friendly and has excellent tips for practicing. I like the way the course is structured, working from a simple blues to more involved but still conforming to the basic blues structure.I was fascinated by pentatonic chords and I am determined to come up with an arrangement of my own using these chord types. The drop-2 approach is a very useful way to get a great sound  and is useful for comping. Guide tones and voice leading are extremely useful also and an essential tool in any jazz performer's portfolio.I plan to practice these various methods and I will probably buy the teacher's book to see if I can advance my skills further.I plan to use the play-along sessions to improve my improvising skills.

The course is sort of a bird's eye view of the field of systems biology such that a beginner would not understand much of anything and an experienced researcher would also not really benefit from it either.

However, the assessments can be tricky - they often require rote learning of specific detail from the lectures (often, detail which isn't highlighted a particularly important). They also occasionally involve difficult to understand questions, and several questions have had spelling or grammatical errors.

She told me that it has helped her learn how to talk with her non-quant executive board and tweak her messaging so that they understand.  The course contains tons of of actual  real-life problems, such as analyzing Flint Michigan's Drinking water data,  testing to find out if a discount store is really the cheapest; figuring out if a marketing plan is working and all sorts of interesting problems.

Balancing all of the biology, informatics, statistics to an audience where you don't know everyone's backgrounds is very challenging but I think this course does a fairly good job of it. I do wish some of the answers were updated, as when you go through some of the analysis using the public tools they may have changed because certain answers I got were very slightly off (1-3) and I had thought it was my fault at first until I checked the forums, so that was annoying at worst. I liked all of the cbio portal lessons and the quizzes where we had to go into the code and change some numbers. The work in the jupyter notebooks felt overwhelming sometimes so I wish I all the codes were slightly more thoroughly explained, but otherwise a satisfying course. Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

      "210  -means-  r Mathematics for Computer ScienceFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Sébastien L•Mar 05, 2019I have learnt quite a few things in this course. However, I will point out that you must be very attentive and not too surprised when you find a mistake, as they are common. I will leave aside the fact that there weren't many classmates around, which prevents you from having meaningful conversations in the forums and feedback on your peer-reviewed assignments, but I believe it is of interest to realize this soon enough as to not have unrealistic expectations. I was especially disappointed with the quality of the quizzes and other assignments: there were many mathematical expressions that weren't formatted correctly which made it very hard to decipher them. Apart from having badly formatted questions (containing spelling mistakes here and there), there are a few instances where even the answers gathered from the grading tools are wrong in some cases and at the very least ambiguous in other cases. I knew most of the material before taking the course and I was unable to achieve a perfect grade, partly due to the fact that there is absolutely no support from the teaching staff and partly due to the grading system used by the university. On the positive side, most of the videos were engaging in my opinion and all the concepts presented are directly useful to any computer scientist. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the course on number bases and modular arithmetic. Depending on your background, you may find the second half of the course somewhat basic, yet still useful. Overall, I would recommend other courses such as CS50 by Harvard University before this one if you are looking for a certificate. Otherwise, you can skip assignments, do not worry too much about the grades and learn important concepts from this course as a great mathematical foundation in computer science.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (4)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Volodymyr B•May 10, 2019I'm on week 3.

The teachers have accents that can be difficult to understand, and all the lessons from Dr Rohrer are pointless, as he doesn't explain anything. He talks about a method or a concept, but merely reads the slides without explaining anything about the formulas or the results. Also, his slow and monotone tone doesn't help at all making the lessons any more intersting. I really think his courses should be done again, because as it is right now, it's quite useless and doesn't teach anything.I apologise for this harsh review, but I honestly think this should be said so changes can me made.The other modules were good, althought i thought the exam questions were quite difficult in comparison to the courses.Best regardsThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy SNEKHA•Apr 02, 2019good  Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Alin-Gabriel D•Aug 18, 2019Things that are good : It's a good overview of mechanism of climate and environmental changes that have occurred and predictions.

However, the lack of practical exercises to actually apply what is covered in the lectures really decreases the course value.

The exams took me several attempts each because some of the material tested on was glossed over in the lectures, and I was unsure of the correct answer.

      "231  -means-  or Business of Games and EntrepreneurshipFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Alex A•Nov 26, 2018While the quality of the lecturer/professor and content production remain high and engaging, this discipline's ROI, value, and learning potential are degrading rapidly.This section seems almost entirely filler, and although I acknowledge that my opinion is partly due to myself not being the target market; the assignment sections don't really even match up with the course content. (i.e. what does creating a game-specific competitive analysis have to do with corporation structures and resume writing?). This was a catch-all bucket of highly subjective content which while at times interesting, was extremely irrelevant to the learning and development I'm seeking/expecting; and that lack of ROI on my time is further destroyed by the activeness and peer-review elements of this class.At the third class in this specialization, I've seen my willingness and effort for each assignment deteriorate. Are these courses dead? (the discussion boards are nothing but spammed links to review assignments from every corner of the earth). The feedback returned from peers is not substantial to improve, and especially with an entire class/section of purely subjective course assignments. In fact, I find myself in some sort of \"pod\", perhaps a result of timing, of receiving the same feedback from the same two-three people, and always in a position of not having any peer assignments to review myself (so I'm forced to go back to a dead forum and pull links of old students' requests for review, just to complete the course). Where are the actual admins and professional mentors/instructors?Overall, I was happy with the learning and new information I received via the first course improving my hard/technical skills. While the second course was more subjective, it was still value-add and incredibly interesting, despite the peer+activeness critiques I elaborated on above. However, I felt this third course was an absolute waste of my time (maybe not so for others, fine), and there's really no tangible ROI to putting in the time or effort here other than trucking through this for the sake of completing the Coursera Discipline. I remain eager and excited for the subsequent courses; as receiving structured guidance towards a Capstone project seems like worthwhile endeavor towards learning and development. Overall, through other courses on other sites like Udemy, this does not seem like something worth spending money on at this point - you just paying for pre-recorded videos with a university's logo slapped on them (albeit from an engaging and passionate professor), outdated/dead links, and almost 0 active students. The courses on Udemy are better managed, updated, and have communities of learners. This series could be posted to Youtube for free and have the same impact - to this point anyway :(Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Axel D•May 21, 2018This course covers the basics of games business, but is clearly aimed at people with no previous work experience in the games industry. If you're already a professional thinking of starting your own company, you'll find some interesting information but a lot of it will also be redundant. I'd also like to point out that the Week 3 assignment requires you to produce a 30-60 second video with a recommended time of 2 hours, which is clearly unrealistic if you expect to produce quality work.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Louis N•Aug 07, 2017Very good course giving more than an overview of games development, which is what it takes to survive in this creative industry. Reality of games development.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Samuel S•Mar 10, 2016Great way to introduce the business of games. Gave me a very thorough understanding of the biggest questions one has about how money works in the industry.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Tobias W•Jan 05, 2018The content of this course is pretty valuable and important for game developers. Everybody wants to be creative and enjoy making games, but it's still a business and you want to make money, right? I went into the course not really expecting to be interested in anything, but a lot of the material was very insightful and will surely help me in the future.Note: The material is mostly US centric, so if you're somewhere else, you'll have to put in some extra work to find out how some of the stuff works in your country.The one thing that I didn't like about this course was that some of the projects didn't have much to do with the material taught during that week and many students were a bit lost on what to do exactly. Don't get discouraged, because everyone is in the same boat. Just see it as a challenge and do some research outside of the course, talk to people on the forums and it'll be fine.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Kelly•Jun 01, 2016I was most excited about taking this class (in fact, it's how I found the specialization as a whole) and I did not get as much out of it as I was hoping for. :-\\ I think that it's geared to too wide of an audience, so we didn't get as specific as I was anticipating. I also felt that a lot of the time of the videos were taken up by telling us what not to do. (\"You don't want to be too far to this side, but you don't want to be too far to the other side, right?\") I did get some good information out of this class, but I found a disconnect between the lectures and the homework. When we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment, it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator pitches--what makes a good (or a bad) elevator pitch? What kind of things would be a good idea to include? Concrete examples would have been super helpful. Submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did vastly different stuff made me question my own submission (Did we just take it in a different direction or did I (or they) misunderstand the assignment?) but since we're all peer reviewing, it's a case of the blind leading the blind there. This also happened with the SWOT Document...which I don't think was even mentioned in the lectures at all in-depth. Again, it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples, as I've never heard of that document before. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Mok K F•Dec 03, 2015This course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry. But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful. For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc. The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two  10-15 minutes long video lectures. Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.The quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all. Some of the \"correct\" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quiz.The third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes. However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics. Unless you are already in the industry, I do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience.

      "235  -means-  r 游戏产业概论Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Yu S•May 18, 2016作为Coursera上第一门中文授课的游戏课程，这门课最初给我的期望值很高。然而就像那句老话说的“期望越大，失望就越大”，下面就说说我的看法吧。首先，课程的体量和内容安排不合理。课程跨度为9周，而很多周的视频不过几分钟而已。内容大纲看似方方面面包罗万象，但游戏史方面讲得很破碎、很跳跃，而讲到游戏类型时却突然插入一段对游戏音乐和音效制作的大篇幅介绍，给人一种比例失衡的感觉。其次，阅读和作业目的性不强。仅仅把一本书的名称、作者、出版社等信息放在那里是不够的，学习者需要知道的是为什么课程在这里推荐这些材料，是对课程相关内容的展开、补充还是提出不同的见解，阅读的重点是什么——哪些内容和观点是特别值得注意的。关于作业的设置，个人感觉没有能反映课程中最重要的知识点，多选题难度不小但看不出记住正确答案的意义有多大，同学互评多为主观论述题，有发挥的空间但评分标准缺乏对“质”的考量，能否引出有意义、有内涵的讨论就不得而知了。再来是课程中的错误：长度不全的视频有几处，也有内容重复的视频；字幕中的错误率高于正常水平；还有就是被不少同学吐槽的“老师的口误”，能读错如此多游戏界知名人士名字以及知名游戏名称的情况也是不多见的。在我看来，这些瑕疵起码透露出老师对于讲述的内容其实并不十分熟悉，还有就是制作的用心程度，有些错误只要细心检查是完全可以避免的。最后想说的是课程里和XX公司及其游戏作品相关的内容。给我的感觉第一门课后期以及第二门设计课程的全部内容都是和XX公司共同制作的（顺便说一句第二门课至少在内容安排上比第一门课好，不知后三门Unity开发的课程能否更好）。这些内容能让学习者一窥国内手游公司以及手游项目研发的真实情况，了解国内手游从业者的日常工作。但我还是要说：真的有广告之嫌，在很多东西尚未真正得到玩家和市场检验之前就如此吹捧真的好吗？以上林林总总，其实一句话，作为学习者我们并不难看出一门课是精心制作的，还是取材现成、随意拼凑的。以下乱发议论，国内手游市场的社交化吸金模式是事实，但窃以为学院派内容不能被市场化（金本位）思想所充斥。过于强调赚钱效应而对游戏原始乐趣追求的缺失，这就是为什么如今我们的游戏市场已经达到了全球瞩目的规模（2015年达全球总规模24%，超过欧洲略少于北美），但却并没有一款内容上被全世界玩家（甚至国内玩家自己）所认可的经典游戏。这就是为什么大家总是说国外游戏玩体验，国内游戏玩成长（这是好听的说法，其实玩的是攀比和炫耀）。游戏研究和设计进入大学视野的时间较晚，国内则起步更晚，但这里更应该是一方净土，尊重市场但不忘初心。Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy qiuqf89•May 08, 2018老师讲的东西很有用。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Vayne-Lover•Aug 13, 2016等待时间太漫长，题目出得不好，只有一个多选题，课中也不提，有时候要猜好几次。另外，最坑爹的是互相评论的作业，连个人都没有，怎么能够早点结束？？？补评：老师是好老师。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy 朱忠杰•Aug 31, 2017很适合初学者来了解游戏的一些大致情况，对游戏有个初步的思考，不是很难的课程适合入门Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy bigbridge•Sep 04, 2017整体的内容安排不错，但最好注意一下PPT的细节 。此外我就记住了一句话，程序员告诉美术：如果卡顿了，你的画再美也显示不出来。哈哈哈，沟通的艺术~Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Luyi L•May 01, 2016已经刷完，在等peer review和各个deadline自动到期了。这门课对于我这样一个对国内游戏或者说娱乐方面完全外行的人还是很有帮助的。虽然有不少错误，比如视频放错，重复。讲师说错一些人物信息一类的。但也很好的概述了行业现状，信息很新。如果视频分块，已经习题能做的更好些，论坛也能够一直关注就更好了。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy 王兆栋•May 07, 2018老师讲得挺认真的，但是我感觉对自己没什么用Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy 刘昶•Mar 20, 2018是为了凑够四门看第五门课的  unity相关的课程内容比较充实  游戏产业的人物介绍让我想到了敖厂长 那个才叫良心Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy wei q•Apr 02, 2016课件粗糙，教师水平低，连介绍的重要人物名字都念错遍，感觉其完全不了解游戏产业。内容没有任何深度和启发性，还不如去百度搜索的效果好。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy 李思汉•Mar 07, 2016在得知复旦大学要推出游戏开发课程的时候，对这套专项课程十分期待，然而观看完第一门课的前五周之后，只能说，太失望了。弃之。原因如下1.老师讲课毫无生气，老和尚念经2.很多讲座视频缺少内容。比如本来应该有十分钟的视频只给播两分钟，剩下的八分钟不知道跑到哪里去了3.个人认为assignment和quiz并不能反映出学习的好坏，或者对学习有所帮助希望这套专项课程的后两门的Unity开发的课程能够给大家一个惊喜。Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Vale G•Apr 16, 2016Advertisement,  Advertisement, AdvertisementThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Shawn•Aug 09, 2019客观来讲，习题让人做得很烦躁，还有相关法律的内容，作为初学者，实在是打击积极性Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

      "238  -means-  r Designing Your Personal Weight Loss PlanFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Joanie T•Oct 10, 2018J'ai choisi de m'inscrire à ce cours et comme je termine toujours ce que je commence, j'ai décidé de le terminer, mais ouf que j'ai trouvé le cours long et ennuyant. J'ai l'impression que ce qui m'a été présenté dans ce cours sont les mêmes informations qui circulent sur la perte de poids depuis les années 1990! Ils nous parlent du guide alimentaire (que beaucoup de pays revoient en ce moment, car c'est de l'information passée date) et nous sommes dirigés vers beaucoup de liens vers le gouvernement des USA. De plus, certains outils suggérés (comme se peser à tous les jours, compter de manière obsessive les calories, avoir un grand déficit calories-énergie dépensée pour prendre du poids, se cacher dans son bureau ou aller faire du sport lorsque les collègues amènent des pâtisseries dans la salle d'employés, etc.) m'a tout de suite mise très inconfortable. Je crois que ces habitudes peuvent vite se transformer en trouble alimentaire ou une obsession qui sera difficile à oublier.Bref, si vous n'avez jamais entendu parler de perte de poids de votre vie ou que vous n'avez jamais lu sur le sujet ou si vous croyez que les méthodes des années 1990 marchent toujours ou que vous croyez qu'il n'existe qu'une seule méthode miracle qui permet de perdre du poids, ce cours est pour vous.

Students can, but they are like me and you here to learn.Some of the material was outdated and needs revision.There are plagiarizers just like in any institution.

We had to contact Coursera several times for weeks to get a simple yet not helpful reply from ESSEC. And it was too late for anything, really... Remember, the whole project lasts for 4 weeks only!Second, several documents required for the weekly assignments were missing! It's fair to say we were all free-styling (i.e. making wild assumptions) our ways through the entire capstone due to lack of necessary information. Third (and most importantly). most of the participants didn't have any basic business background whatsoever. Be prepared to get a bad grade from someone who's clueless about hotel business, not to mention revenue or demand management. That really makes you wonder how these people even passed the last three core courses....Forth, this capstone is great for those who just want to get a certificate for the sake of having a certificate. Did you notice those 4 or 5 star ratings with no written reviews? Yeah, they were probably trying to show their appreciation for the easy certificate. After all, it's easy to walk away with a decent grade when there's no one knows what's going on. ANYTHING GOES! However, if you are a serious learner who wants to actually learn something, run away from this capstone. You will be thanking me later.All in all, a horrible experience and I wish I could get those 4 weeks of my life back!

Queria saber primeiramente a qualidade do curso antes de pagá-lo. O curso oferece ótimas referências na aba de leituras, tanto livros, artigos, quanto os diversos softwares utilizados em UI. Os dois primeiros módulos achei mediano e muito raso, mas do terceiro módulo para o final, achei as informações bastante pertinentes, inclusive sobre softwares de calor, testes A/B. Por ser para iniciante, o curso é completo. No quesito vídeos e áudios, é necessário melhorar. Em alguns vídeos, o microfone do professor/orientador estava abaixo da música de fundo. Em outros, o áudio tinha um certo eco. Sei que não são profissionais com a expertise de aula, mas alguns tinha uma didática ruim, pareciam que estavam lendo scripts e falando roboticamente. Em alguns momentos, precisei utilizar a legenda ou ler o texto que fica logo abaixo dos vídeos (que é um ótimo ponto). No geral, o curso é satisfatório.

Além de pouco didático.

Some questions are redundant such as the name of the person who designed the data science methodology or  questions specific to the case study and does not necessarily provide insight into general concepts.3) Simply reading what is in the slides is not a good use of videos and cannot keep the focus of the students for a long time.4) This course might be located after the Python for Data Science course or even later so that the students could have a more meaningful final assignment, actually applying what they learned on a small data set.5) Knowing a subject and teaching a subject are two different things.

      "247  -means-  or Applied Text Mining in PythonFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy David M•Nov 06, 2018It is no exaggeration to say it took me longer to complete this course than the first 3 courses in the specialty and the time was utterly wasted. I wouldn't object if I felt like I was learning new skills but it is mostly battling a poorly constructed course, with terrible assignments, a broken autograder and a Professor who is utterly disinterested in the education of his students.When considering this course we need to separate the subject (which is fascinating) and the tools (which seem quite powerful) from the course itself. I had really high hopes during the lectures in week 1, where the videos are stronger and close to a well taught university lecture than others in the specialisation. However the assignments and the autograder issues are too great to ignore! Assignments are poorly worded (in one question it is literally trial and error) and the autograder often breaks. There are cases of people spending 10+ hours on work getting incredibly frustrated by the lack of feedback to find out the solutions were correct and the autograder was playing up. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (18)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Li Q•Aug 10, 2018Very painful going through this course although i have quite well coped with course 1-3. But this course seems lack of systematic structure of building the knowledge, it just walked through the topics quickly and extensively. I had to spend a few hours to learn about the whole structure of text mining to build in-depth knowledge, more than 20 hours to watch the online nltk & genism tutorials cause i m new to text mining & nlp. just hope the course can simplify the complicated topics such as where we are in the whole process, what's it, why we need it, working theory, coding, how we use these parameters, etc. to make life easier.

Week 4 assignment doesn't do enough to bring all the previous topics together in a realistic application. Week 3 lectures and notebook have teach the use of a scoring function wrongly - an issue addressed in forum threads for months but no edits to the video lectures and notebook have been made as of yet.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy David C•Aug 08, 2017I really wanted to like this course, and there were some redeeming features, but overall I'm unable to recommend it in its current state.  IMO, the lectures were at much too high a level while the programming assignments were very detailed with vague instructions and little guidance.  There was no link between what was discussed in class and how the fine details of the assignments were to be understood.  In addition, the course was published with errors in the auto-grader and no resources in the Resources link (not even slide decks from the lectures, so to review material you were forced to re-visit all the recorded lectures which was very inefficient).   My recommendation to Coursera and the Univ of Michigan is to completely re-do the course, doubling the number of lectures to provide not just the broad overview of the topics, but also some detailed descriptions of recommended ways to implement what was discussed.   I would also recommend using Professor Andrew Ngs Machine Learning course as a guide for how to create great programming assignments, with detailed PDFs (typically 5-6 pages) describing what is to be done AND WHY (linking back to the lectures) and \"telling a story\" that is cohesive and leads the student to create something end-to-end (in small steps) that does something amazing by the end.  The programming assignments in this course seemed, in contrast, to be a shotgun blast of \"do this\", \"create this\", \"make this happen\" with little context of how the small pieces fit together or what the overall goal of the assignment is to accomplish -- and at the end, a feeling of \"I passed the autograder's expections, but have no idea what I've really done or why\".  There were so many great things that could have been done with the Text Mining topic, and this course touched on just a few in a very haphazard way that simply left me confused and wondering why I spent so much time to learn so little.

Also, the level of engagement by other users was dramatically lower. I saw no responses in the forums, it was hard to peer review, and despite my many pleas for assistance, I could not find people to review my assignments. The content was still good and the structure was generally okay. I also reported an error in one of the quizzes and the response did not address my concern. I also reported a bogus peer review and the response was completely useless. Peer Review assignments will lead to my abandoning this certificate course. Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

Lecture had nothing to do with the quizzes, quizzes had nothing to do with the final assignment, final assignment had nothing to do with the lectures. Fight through it, there is light at the end of the tunnel.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy ALEXEY P•Nov 18, 2017If you thought that the previous course (Statistical Inference) with Brian Caffo was a horrible experience -- think twice and get ready for Regression Models. It is way worse. Imagine an instructor starting his explanation by showing you some (rather involved) formula and immediately jumping to the discussion of  the various terms without actually telling you clearly what this formula is for and how to use it. Then you will get a pretty good idea about the instructor for this course. He is a horrible teacher, who clearly does not understand what teaching is and how it should be done properly. Total waste of time.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy George C•Apr 30, 2018This is the worst course in the series. Caffo does a terrible job at explaining regression, the final assignment requirements aren't properly addressed, and it appears they didn't quite spend time on how to make it all work (2 pages to test out different regression models, make an inference, and everything else is absurd). I highly recommend avoid this course, and instead go through the R guide on linear regression; in the end, I used those to get through this course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Ricardo M•Jan 30, 2018Just like the previous course in the specialization path (Statistical Inference) the course delves into some relevant topics however it doesn't feel as properly structured. While on the first week the lectures seem to try to give a basic and comprehensible learning of linear regression, once we start into the more advanced topics it gets confusing.Lots of formulas and concepts thrown at you without much clarification. For someone without any knowledge/background on statistics this can be quite difficult to grasp the concepts.The module for Poisson Regression is very poor in terms of information. just feels like a very light overview of the matter.The course should be reviewed or at least the indication of \"Beginner Specialization.No prior experience required.\" should be updated to mention that some knowledge in statistics is recommended .Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Johnny C•Sep 25, 2018One video is wrongly edited, half of it is repeated. The instructor gives too much information and is difficult to follow, some information is even trivial.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Nicholas A•Dec 22, 2017Personally, I am not a fan of this professor. He over-explains all of the topics, just to tell you at the end of the lecture that you don't need to know the specifics and can do it all with one function. He is very unengaging, difficult to follow, and rushes through lectures. And finally, HE BLOCKS THE SLIDES WITH HIS HEAD SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE NOTES. I feel like out of all the professors in this specialization course, there were so many others who could have taught the material better, especially since this is probably the most important course of the entire specialization. I feel like I only began to understand the material once I finished the course project, and even then I have no idea how regression models work.I'm now going to be taking a month or 2 off from the courses to read more about statistical inference and regression models on my own, since I feel completely unprepared for the upcoming Machine Learning course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Claudio F S•Mar 11, 2019This module was the maximum.

Thank you!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Joana P•Jan 26, 2018Honestly the materials of this course are really confusing. So many focus on the mathematical value instead of real examples and scenarios to use the concepts reached. Also it would benefit if there was a clear message coming through, like Machine Learning course where things follow a order.If it was not by the book of Mr.Field with Statistics in r, I would never be able to understand what was really being said in this course. Or what was the best strategy to effectively do a proper regression analysis and what would be the best models. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy cleoag1•Oct 29, 2017Very math heavy and not super useful for psychology students. Without a tutor, that I had to pay $30 an hour in addition to this course, I would not have passed. The layout was rather convoluted, there were several spelling mistakes (one that completely changed the meaning of a QUIZ question) and it was not as conceptual as I was hoping for. The conceptual limitation is big for me as I don't care about the math, I'm a psych undergrad trying to learn statistics for my honors thesis, not a math course. It also made it difficult to apply what we learned since the data we worked with wasn't that easy to understand and was incredibly boring (car mpg data and insect sprays??). I'm also slightly upset that coursera signed me up for a subscription when all I wanted was one course, very cheeky. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Jeffrey G•Oct 18, 2017I was optimistic about this class because it started out fixing some of the pedagogical mistakes the professor made in Statistical Inference, but by the time we got to week 3, it was pretty clear that the course was trying to accomplish too much in 4 weeks, and instead of focusing on the most important parts of regression and making sure they were taught well and understood clearly, I feel the course tried to do far too much.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star was the course project was relatable - choosing the best transmission for maximizing mpg is a real-world problem that I can (and did) have a discussion with my mother about.  Too many assignments are about something completely inane, like guinea pig teeth or flower petals.  If you're going to inspire students to learn the material, the examples (and data) must be relatable to them.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy André C L•Dec 13, 2018very good practical approach, with good theoretical coverage of most important principles of regressionThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy David R•Dec 05, 2018Great course, well taught with very useful examplesThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Antonio V•Jan 09, 2019very good courseThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy sneha•Jan 23, 2019Amazing course ! finally I have learned how to implement regression in real world analysisThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy João F•Feb 06, 2019Excellent but difficult course.

      "266  -means-  Solving Algorithms for Discrete OptimizationFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Alex D•Oct 11, 2018The course is a good sequel in the “… Discrete Optimization” series. With just about any programming language, the true understanding of how the program is run by the computer helps tuning the program, minimizing the execution time. The same is especially true in optimization, as instead of the “classical” imperative programs we have “models” that are digested by some “solver”, which actually does all the number crunching. Different solvers (and the same solver with different configuration) can behave drastically different while running the same model. So this course finally removes the veil and uncovers the things inside these solvers, that were considered as black boxes in the previous two courses. The course is likely to motivate you to experiment with different solvers for the same models, and, maybe, even implementing your own solver.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Jan G•May 11, 2019very good introduction, lessons are fun to watch and exercises are usefulThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Leo•Jun 20, 2019Great innovation for new way of thinking Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

      "The course is really interesting and the lectures and lecturers are great. It is insightful and provides basic knowledge mainly oriented to the assessment of wind power availability. If you seek a more turbine oriented approach (aerodynamics, turbine manufacturing and etc), this is not a good option. Great problem, in my opinion: evaluation system is very poor. Many items are not well formulated and it's hard to understand your mistakes after failing a test try. It became so uncomfortable that led me to only giving 3 stars.

Especially after several failed attempts on quiz, there should be some guide on how to answer, just as in the WIND ENERGY course.All the same, i have gained a lot from this course, even though i have not being able to answer only one question to get my certificate.

But as many other reviewers have already mentioned, the quiz questions are sometimes truly frustrating. No hints, no answers in the lectures, and no help in the forums, apart from the fellow students as annoyed as myself. All that made me end up simply trying out all possible combinations (and that with multiple ticks makes no less than 31 combinations - hi, combinatorics! - and 3 tries in 8 hours), which is clearly not the way I would like to spend my youth. Also there are some maths typos in the slides in some lectures that make it difficult to get into the subject, and I'm almost sure that some of the answers in one of the last quizzes are wrong - but no way to figure it out, since no feedback is provided anyway. So my resolution is that the contents of the course are quite good and well-organised for a motivated beginner, but the moderation is the aspect that should be looked upon for sure.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Seyed M E•Nov 05, 2019\n",

Some of these issues were reported months or years ago.There is no feedback (hints or suggestions) after taking graded quizzes other than the scores themselves.

The lectures are very interesting and the overall level is high. You need to have some good knowledge about the structure and the working of the brain or you won't be able to follow the lectures (the level is higher than with most MooC here)  The main problem with this MooC though is that there is nothing more than academic lectures. The forum are empty, there is no (sense of) community, this long course (12 weeks) lacks some storytelling linking weeks together, and, worse of all, the quizzes are useless: very short, simplistic,  you may even pass guessing the correct answers. Such high level lectures demand for high quality quizzes allowing the students to really test and challenge the acquired knowledge. Quizzes and all sorts of interactive exercises must be included in the experience.

I learned more from examples given the textbook. Since there didn't seem many learners on this course, it was quite frustrating to find a little mistake that I was making, but I guess that understanding whether the mistakes are conceptual or computational is also an important part of financial engineering.

      "285  -means-  or Front-End Web Development with ReactFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Marek T•Mar 08, 2019I was really excited to find this specialization. I work with React andfull stack JavaScript for several years now, and I am always lookingfor high quality learning resources for me and other developers frommy company. I thought an university level course will surely qualifyas such a resource, but oh my, was I wrong.The instructor clearly doesn't have any real world react experience. Theinstructions in the course go maybe a bit beyond basic and FREEtutorials on the websites of React, React Native and other used technologies.The whole specialization is very basic and I can honestly tell you, thatthe knowledge acquired in this course would not be even close to what I wouldexpect from a junior developer before considering him for a position.Application created during the course is trivial and will not prepare youfor real world development. Another really astonishing thing for me were the assignments. I simplycannot understand how a course created under the name of a university canprovide such ridiculous amount of hand holding. Pretty much everything isgiven to you, all the way down to details like how you need to name your functions.To sum in up, on the plus side I did appreciate:1. The idea of a full stack JS development course.2. Technologies chosen for such a course.On the other hand, my biggest issues are with:1. Too trivial.2. No automated testing.3. No architecture. A project structured by this course, would be hell to work with in just   a slightly larger code base.4. Very sloppy coding.5. And worst of all: usage of well-known antipaterns. Eg.: functions in render   methods of components.I would advise anyone to save their money and just read throughout officialReact documentation.

I loved the way you start a project from the week 1 and finish parts of it as assignments during the course. This actually helped me focus on the learning rather than getting stuck in the assignments. The concepts were clear.

It requires only extremely basic Fusion skills.I would be much happier with some production-related task that suggests developing a part optimized for a prescribed set of manufacturing tools... or something like that.The long discussion of the quadcopters on week4 was a complete  waste  of time for me.

The sum of posts for all instructors and mentors on forum is 0, which means you can ask, but they do wont answer. All the assignment has to be reviewed by peers, because it seems that none of the author even cared about making the grader (even I do thing it is possible for most of the assignments). Quizzes are also somehow put together, but you wont get much from them.Instructors are only reading and not explaining, so there is a lot of moments, where instructor just stop saying something because he is waiting for the text.

Without doubt the most challenging courses I've ever done in coursera! I have a few suggestions for anyone who is considering to start this course:1- You have to be a skillful programmer, be comfortable with algorithm design, tree and graphs structures and recursion. Also a general knowledge of models are useful.2- You have to have enough patience to watch loooooooong videos (but the professor teaches in a pretty awesome and in times, hilarious ways!)3- You really need to spend +15 hours per week on this course, not only the videos for each week is long but also each programming assignment will take tremendous amount of your time!4- And finally you should be tough and not give up and sometimes have the courage to write your code again from scratch after failure!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Melissa J•Nov 03, 2018Very difficult. Harder than pretty much all of the courses I've taken in college, more or less, based on how much material is covered and the amount of research you have to do on top of the lectures in order to just get a passing grade on the assignments. Definitely a grad level course, probably harder than most grad level courses I've taken in college just for the amount of effort needed to get a perfect score on all assignments (unfortunately it depends on how good of a computer you have to run your solutions). The challenge just makes it even more fun. Lectures barely covers anything needed to do the assignments, which just gives you a surface level introduction to the concepts needed to solve the problems. The discussion forum is crucial to getting good guidance on how to solve the problems. Pretty much all of the assignments involved doing your own research and reading a bunch of problem-related research papers to figure out what you want to use for your own implementations. I had a blast learning, and thank you so much for offering this course on coursera.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Max B•Jan 24, 2017This course is absoutely excellent.

IT IS PRINCETON POLICY, AND PRINCETON WILL NOT CHANGE FOR YOU.  WHEN YOU SIGN UP THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY CHANCE TO PAY, AND IT WILL NOT APPEAR LATER.Taking the above into consideration, this is still a very good all around review of networking principles.  Nothing terribly deep, but it can't be broad and deep while being doable in this timeframe.  The math is easy, so long as you can keep track of iterations and the value changes from one to the next, the actual math is super easy (and there's never more than a handful of iterations).  Jumps around a bit wildly from topic to topic, but they are all interesting and necessary to know about.  Very little extraneous material, though some of the parts are dated (principles are still useful though).  Wifi still uses wait and listen, just a lot differently.  The class also argues heavily that pay per use plans are better than flat fee, and the math supported it, but the business model has swung away from that and back to flat.  None of this matters though, it's the ideas and principles behind everything that are critical to understand in today's world.  None of those are changing in any significant way until my quantum computer hits the market.  One problem is that the teachers of the class are LONG gone, if you are looking for answers to questions and things of that nature forget it.  There are also a couple of broken lecture links and messed up exam questions.  These have been pointed out for several years, would be ridiculously easy to fix, and nothing has ever been done, so no instructor is listening to any of us, ever.5/5 stars given it is free, and so long as you go in knowing you can't get any certificate.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy PC•Jul 04, 2019Using themes and analogies, this course successfully give a holistic view.

      "300  -means-  r Capstone Design Project in Power ElectronicsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Carsten S•Nov 01, 2018The lectures of this specialization were really great, but I did not like the design project too much. From technial point of view, the implementation of the circuit has been very interesting as well, but there are  a few things that could be improved. a) the time frame is quite challenging if you have a full time job and a family (and have to remind everything from the last 10 months) I think it should therefore at least be avoided to introduce new things that could have been done easily in the lectures (LTSpice transformer model etc.).b) there is almost no support in the forum for anything. 80% of the questions remain completely unanswered, although there are not too many questions in the end. That's a pitty.c)  The final result of the peer review is highly dependent on LTSpice and especially the rubrics of milestone 2 could be improved regarding these problems. The convergence problems of LTSpice are well known and can be caused by anything (version, OS, whatever).  It is very easy to fail this milestone for problems that are actually not caused by you. d) I've had very inconsistent review results and ended up not knowing what was wrong or how to improve. There is nothing much to do about this, but still I'd wish to get some more input regarding my designs. As a result, I have a design that somehow passes the milestones, but is far away from something that i would want to \"sell\".  I also see that is difficult to implement a project like this, so it's fine in the end, but maybe a few changes could improve the situation for the students. In summary, the whole specialization is still a great thing to do, so thanks to the professors for sharing their knowledge with us.

As a electrical engineer designing lab and industrial use power supplies, I found the material in this class review and enhance my knowledge, and more importantly, a systematic view of DC-DC converter concepts, which is a good reference of my future career.The book those professors wrote is called \"bible\" in the power electronic industry, and most of the interviewers will ask questions related to the material in that book when you take a job interview in this industry, especially for an entry level or junior position. Watching the videos and doing the homework and final project help me understand those material more efficiently. The six classes are still too short for all the material. Some good techniques such as soft-start, snubber, and input filtering may be added, even as an optional video. And I am also looking forward to some advance classes with the material like digital control, resonant (LLC) and soft switching, which is popular and widely used in the industry recently.About this final capstone design project, it leads me through the procedure: transfer the requirement to topology selection -> open loop design -> linear modeling and ac analysis -> final time domain analysis. Further, the requirements are well designed so that I need to make trade-offs during these procedure. It takes me quite a while to do the tweaking and simulation iteration, but I found it is a good practice. This is the real life of an engineer! I appreciate the great work from all three professors!

However, the way the course was instructed did not meet my expectations.Firstly, content is recited over the videos, this means, students are to sit watching a video of an instructor that talks about complex subjects in a monochrome tone of voice, with the exception of 2-3 speakers. Reciting a content leaves no room for the audience to interpret the subjects, but to learn by heart what was said leading to no motivation from the audience. Secondly, this way of \"teaching\" made quizzes extremely, not to mention unnecessarily, complex for the answers needed to be a copy/paste from the lessons, changing one word could lead to an incorrect answer. Thirdly, why not providing the right answers after succeeding a test, how are we supposed to know the right answers of those questions we did not get right?. Not to talk about the various technical issues, like running out of quiz attempts after using only 2 chances making you hand in the assignments late, marking right answers wrong even when you had a screen shot of the exact words from the video lessons, finding out that your first answers were correct after 8 attempts. Not being able to interact with the instructors when in doubt or in need of clarification.Overall, sadly, I did not have a good experience doing this course; therefore, I would not recommend. I enrolled in the course to have a better understanding of what the career was before going through admissions for a diploma degree. Now I come to realize that paying for this course was not necessary for completing the certificate did not change the outcome. I could have just followed the course without the hazard of completing the assignments, that would have been enough.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Phillip G•Aug 16, 2019My opinion is\n",

Which is why the assignments were hard as questions had content which was sometimes not mentioned even briefly in the video. Considering it as a course in ID, I did expect more variations and more resources to read. Sometimes the narrators tone became monotonous. Further I struggled a lot with Quiz 4 and found the content to be highly disconnected from it. The quiz had a few application based questions, particularly question 3 and 5 which were too difficult had not reference in the video and no readings were assigned for the that week. Also It would be nice if instructors were more responsive to individual posts than just big threads, as my doubts were not responded to. More interaction with instructors through a message tool or any other way will make the course more enriching.

He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems. The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz.

      "310  -means-  r Calculus: Single Variable Part 4 - ApplicationsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Sanchit S•Aug 21, 2016Hey guys. So I just completed a Discrete Calculus course, offered by UPenn, through Coursera. I'd like to give a you guys an overview of the course, and my experience through this journey.This, 5 part course, is designed to be completed within 21 weeks, with a work time of 6-8 hours a week. However, if you're really dedicated and have enough time, you can probably finish it within 8 weeks (like me). Oh, and it is taught by Prof. Robert Ghrist (he's cool, trust me).First, for the prerequisites, you should have taken at least Calculus AB, to do well in this course. Practice with advanced integration techniques and some prior knowledge of Taylor Series is a plus.Part 1 of the course begins with a study of Taylor Series. From what I've noticed, part 1 emphasizes the importance of using Taylor Series to develop an intuition about the behavior of a function at limits such as 0 and infinity. After revisiting some familiar topics with the perspective of Taylor, part 1 ends with introducing asymptotic analysis (big O), which took me a while to grasp.Part 2 is review for the most part. However, it helps to further strengthen the idea of differentials, and their uses. Some bonus lectures introduce topology, and spacial curvature. Also, there is an introduction to the algebra of operators (which is elaborated in part 5) Some BC topics are also reviewed.Part 3 mostly deals with practicing integration techniques, however emphasizes on Differential Equations (with specific focus on coupled oscillators). Formal definite integrals are introduced. Some more BC topics are reviewed.Part 4, focuses on applying knowledge from the preceding parts. Although it starts off easy with areas, volumes, and arc length, the focus shifts to statistics and physical applications. There is a weird study of Work. Rotational Inertia and PDFs are taught in tandem. There is a brief study of high dimension spaces and hyper volumes. Centroids are taught through the use of double integrals.Finally, part 5 introduces discrete calculus. Basically, continuous calculus, retaught with the perspective of series, in a discretized, non continuous setting. It begins with the study of finite differences, and a rather comprehensive practice of discrete integration. Differential equations (aka recursion relations) are taught, through the use of operators. Then, the focus shifts to numerical analysis, by introducing methods to approximate integrals (like Runge Kutta method). Following that, there is a very comprehensive study of convergence of series. And trust me, it is taught super well (way more in-depth than BC). Finally, the focus shifts to the rather obscure Taylor Remainder Theorem. This might be review for some.This course was pretty challenging for me. I spent a lot of time doing my homework, and taking really good notes (for future reference). After a fee of $50, I earned my course certificate after the final exam (sigh).This is a super cool course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Michael C•May 03, 2019Great course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Louis J C J•Feb 15, 2019There is lots of material covered but the course hangs together well.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Rafael C•Jun 17, 2019I can fully comprehend the purpose of this part, application, but the contradiction is that for students majoring in business, sociology or whatever, we're not bothered about how calculus can be applied in physics or geometry. Only the last part of probability is of interest to me. So I would propose that this part should be redesigned for different fields of application instead of integrating all different disciplines into one part, cuz much of the whole offering will have no connection with my later study. Yet the content of the course itself is good.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Ricardo S L•Apr 29, 2018Great that prof does not feed you with a spoon, but makes you work to understand the content.

It was designed beautifully and to maximize skill building.  I really like the idea of using two different databases.  However, the Teradata database was down way too long, much longer than it was up.  People had to pay extra than planned to continue taking the course as a result.  The instructors planned everything beautifully-except developing a backup plan in case the third party Teradata server went down, which it did.  If the instructors or the university with they are affiliated have no control over this additional server, leaving the students helpless, they really should reconsider their use of materials outside of which they have direct control.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Franklin D•Dec 14, 2017I thought it was good overall for teaching SQL and I enjoy Jana a lot... howeverbiggest issues were the time taking much longer than expected and the Junyper Notebooks not functioning, giving me even more time issues.Also some typos in the quiz answer sheets and lack of clarity in questions (when clarity is extremely important for the answer!)Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Schwinn C•Aug 29, 2018The data sets are very hard to understand.

They take you through the step by step process of learning everything and also provide a lot of material (weekly quizzes and exercises) to review and truly test your understanding of what you've learnt. This course takes quite a lot of time which is great because it means that if you get through it you will have learnt a lot! Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Justin•Feb 29, 2016It's a good class and I learned a lot. The learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week.

Hope advancement for this course and the better experience of users.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Neal D•Feb 05, 2017Poor performance of Jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitments really sunk this one for me. The latter, especially is inexcusable. The syllabus is lopsided and, while organized, not enough thought has been given to the exercise workload.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Christine D•Jul 08, 2019The exercises force you to think deeply about what you're doing, and use a variety of useful sql logic. However the environment works against you: both environments lack the syntax highlighting that would make these questions so much easier in sql server. The Teradata environment only allows you to view about 10 lines of code without scrolling, and has no tab or autocomplete. This was fine up until the last test where some of my queries were 30 lines or more. The last week was so painful that I would recommend other learners find a different course. Such a shame because the exercises are thoughtfully designed and I did learn a lot.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Eva•Apr 11, 2017Really bad course.

The instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy, but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless. I, for one, need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanations. I paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises, which I also think it's a minus. All in all it didn't \"ENHANCE\" my career prospects, mostly because nothing useful was taught here.

      "316  -means-  or Linear Regression and Modeling Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Diego R G•May 26, 2019It's a very good course for starting to learn about linear regression. Just be aware that the quality of this course is a bit lower than the previous two. There are fewer videos, the book material is shorter (less suggested exercises and the chapters cover fewer things about linear regression) and some quiz exercises of week 2, which should only cover simple linear regression, have some questions about multiple linear regression which is the 3rd week's topic. Also, as in the previous two courses, the emphasis is on statistics, not programming with R. This means that if you already know statistics and only want to learn how to use R, there are probably better courses out there for you. But if you want to learn or improve your knowledge of statistics, and also learn how to use R, then do take this course. I think that it's much better to start learning R by actually doing some statistical work and seeing first hand what the software is capable of doing with only a few lines of code, even if you don't fully understand the code's syntax at first.With all that said, if you take the course PAY ATTENTION TO THE LECTURES, READ THE CHAPTERS and DO THE SUGGESTED EXERCISES. I can't stress this enough. If you don't do all of that, you won't learn as much as you should, and it's painfully obvious that some students didn't do all of that when you review their final R projects. Also, take your time with that final project because that's where you will actually learn some things about R and use what you have learned about statistics (you will have to use google to learn how to code some things properly).Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Mindaugas Z•Jan 07, 2019The course is good regarding concepts and theoretical exercises, but poor regarding applying new knowledge in R. Since the course is introductory, an instruction how to install R and a list of R functions without clear explanation how they should be applied in general regression situations makes me explore other sources to learn how to apply those concepts (e.g. DataCamp, CRAN-RProject, etc) and then get back to learn theory? Sorry for expectations but course should provide a full and integrated package of knowledge and skills, especially for beginners. Furthermore, no Machine Learning (ML) is covered as a tool to run a regression. My proposal is to provide an algorithm with a comprehensive example how to run a regression using R. From data to final model, step-by-step.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Richard M•Feb 05, 2019Really great course, clear and easy to follow.

Если не знаешь - то ничего не поймешь. Отвратительное изложение материала. Для сравнения -  объяснение производных в Академии Хана. Там материал изложен более чем понятно. Здесь же - классическое советское преподавание - куча формул - и никому не понятно для чего это нужно. Слайды просто проговариваются слово в слово и без объяснений.

Главное чтобы был более понятен тем, кто учился на тройки :) Спасибо.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (10)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Ekaterina S•Jan 30, 2019Обещались \"вводить многие понятия \"на пальцах\"\", чтобы \"не утонуть в формализме\" и \"сохранить практическую направленность специализации\". На деле очень скучно и скомкано пересказывают питоновские мануалы и учебники по математике, которые и без лекторов можно легко найти в интернете. Что касается \"практической направленности\", в квизах нет ни одной задачи ни на программирование, ни по математике — сплошные вопросы по теории а-ля \"дифференциал - это ...\". Где тут \"практическая направленность\", непонятно. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (10)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Гусаров Г  А•Sep 30, 2018Курс, скорее, выдвигает требования к тем знаниям, которые вы должны иметь для прохождения дальнейшей специализации. Подойдет для повторения ранее изученных материалов, но не для приобретения новых знаний. Обязательно смотрите список рекомендуемой литературы. Питон так же стоит попрактиковать перед прохождением отдельно. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Медведева А В •Nov 05, 2018Очень хорошо объясняют математику , но все что касается программирования , а в частности Python вы его не освоете , здесь обучают на версии 2.7  , а ее уже давно не поддерживают .Советую параллельно самим осваивать Python 3 .В связи с этим всего 3 из 5. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Pavel P•Oct 17, 2017Курс ничему не учит. Если вы не учились на мат. специальности в университете, лучше даже не начинать его.  Единственная практическая польза курса в том, что на основании вопросов в курсе можно составить список необходимых для изучения тем, которые можно изучить в других курсах или , например, в открытых лекциях MIT.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Artem D•Oct 27, 2018Курс, скорее, не обучающий, а \"освежающий\" знания. Когда я взялся его делать в первый раз, то застопорился уже на первом program assignment. В итоге курс отложил и пошел заниматься программированием, линалом, матаном и теорвером. Вернулся через пару месяцев, и курс зашел хорошо. Если вы ожидать от курса, что он будет учить \"с нуля\", т.е. со школьной программы, то курс окажетс плохим. Если отнестись к курсу, как быстрое овервью того, что понадобится дальше в специализации, то курс хороший. Чтобы курс зашел хорошо, рекомендую, как минимум, пройти 'Программирование на Python' на Stepik от Института Биоинформатики (это бесплатно), математику подтягивайте походу специализации.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Andrey E•Feb 20, 2019Курс все еще не обновлен до Python 3, а уже пора бы. https://pythonclock.org/Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Daniel B•Mar 29, 2019Очень сжатое и поверхностное изложение всех тем, без периодического гугления курс проходить довольно затруднительно.

А сейчас объясню, за что я совокупно срезал три звезды: 1) Прививание анаконды. Ради ее установки перелопатил весь реестр (не устанавливается, если имя пользователя на русском). Я предпочитаю вижуал студио. Решение простое: уберите первое задание, где нужно использовать то это ваш жупитер (после установки были десятки проблем с его запуском, на 10-ой винде работает только третий питон) 2) Отсутствие необходимой информации о методах, которые нужны при решении задач. Не проблема найти - проблема в смысле покупки курса. Он экономит очень мало времени при решении ВАШИХ же задач. Вам неоднократно говорили об этом в комментарий ( за игнор замечаний дополнительно снята звезда).  3) Нет вспомогательный упражнений к каждому уроку по конкретным элементам программирования. Ну простите, это идиотизм, так как без них эффект от пассивного просмотра видео очень низкий. ИМХО учебные простое упражнения ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО должны быть в каждом уроке. 4) РЕКОМЕНДАЦИЯ: сделаете возможность сдаться и посмотреть авторское решение с подробным разбором (при этом за решение 0 баллов). А ЛУЧШЕ дайте возможность получать авторский код квантами, в виде готовых решений подзадач (например, токенизация), снимая при этом баллы в зависимости от количества подсказок. Thumbs UpThis is helpful (4)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Суханов С С•Jan 27, 2019Курс составлен очень плохо. Вопросы порой так сформулированы, что времени больше уходит не на поиск ответа, а на понимание того что хотел сказать автор. Знания на мой взгляд даются на полные. Даётся общее представление о библиотеке pandas и сразу идёт задание в котором знаний требуется больше чем в уроке. Зачем тогда вообще подбный урок если можно было сразу давать ссылку на документацию?По математике также, очень много вопросов которые не объясняются в курсе и требуется либо знать заранее. Либо искать ответы самостоятельно.Понимаю, что тема сложная, но курс сам по себе ужасен в не зависимости от сложности темы. Он отлично подойдет тем кто уже разбирается в данной областе и хочет еще больше разобраться. Если же у вас нет знаний по теме и вы не разбираетесь в библиотеках python о которых идёт речь в курсе у вас постоянно будут возникать проблемы.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (4)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Dmitrii M•Mar 14, 2016Подготовка лекторов отвратительная. Снято в один дубль. Делать ошибки в коде и предлагать поискать ошибки и опечатки - просто великолепно. Курс далеко не самый дешевый, но при этом качество обучения низковато. Очень обидно, материал интересный и хочется его изучить, но по факту данный курс просто задает вектор обучения, а учиться уже приходится самостоятельно используя сторонние ресурсы. Учиться ради сертификата? Сомнительный довод. Если нет цели пройти специализацию, советую выбрать другой курс, благо выбирать есть из чего, и многие курсы обойдутся дешевле.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Alexander S•Mar 06, 2016Странный баланс.

У меня было так, потому что просто не понимал, зачем могут быть нужны все эти матрицы, векторы, кроме как для фундаментальных теоретических исследований, которые меня мало интересовали. Оказалось, это может быть полезно и на практике. Курс хорошо освежает в памяти забытые формулы и понятия. Однако, из-за предельной краткости и лаконичности изложения некоторые вещи остаются не понятными и приходится обращаться к дополнительным источникам, но это вполне нормально.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Петренко А•Oct 07, 2019Несмотря на оставленную мной высокую оценку к курсу, считаю необходимым указать несколько замечаний. 1) Этот курс явно не для начального уровня в математике. Требуется достаточно серьезная подготовка либо наличие времени на то, чтобы все время гуглить и читать доп.литературу.  У меня не было подготовки (институт окончил давно, да и внимание математики я не уделял должного, так как гуманитарий), но было свободное время. Очень помог сайт Емелина Александра по высшей математике. Можно сказать по этому сайту я действительно изучил за 2 месяца первые два курса высшей математики вуза))) То есть прошу обратить внимание, что мне потребовалось времени 2 месяца, а не месяц как указано в программе. Можно было бежать и вперед быстрее, но тогда был бы риск не усвоения материала, а это как показывает практика чревато последствиями в самые неожиданные моменты)2) Требуются базовые знания в питоне. Здесь мне повезло. Перед этим я уже прошел курс с говорящим названием, поэтому в части кода больших проблем не возникало. Можно сказать больше, отточил навыки и узнал интересные приемчики, особенно на последней неделе курса.3) Не совсем связанная подача материала, вернее даже не совсем ясно для чего нам говорили о некоторых вещах. Возможно я узнаю об этом на следующих курсах.В остальном курс прекрасен))Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Gleb D•Aug 09, 2018Лучший вводный курс, который я видел.

      "328  -means-  or How To Create a Website in a Weekend! (Project-Centered Course)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Łukasz P•Oct 23, 2018This course is a collection of some resources. It is not very consistent and does not provide enough understanding of a subject or resources and knowledge to setup a wordpress page, let alone create a whole website. My impression is that more work could be put in to make it a good course. I'm glad I did not spend any $ on that.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Trupti S•Mar 22, 2016The title of this course is so inspirational that I actually ended up creating a website in a weened.

It doesn't provide you any technical information. Plus assignment feedbacks are very weak.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Paul R B•Apr 12, 2018For the low cost this might be a good course for many who want some ideas about web site design.  But the course description is misleading (you DO have to be somewhat proficient in Wordpress or another platform) so the idea that you can have no experience at this is simply false.  Furthermore, there is no feedback or interaction at all with the course \"instructors\".  You're simply reliant on your peers for feedback some of whom don't write in English well enough to comprehend.  The organization of the course is a little twisted in that some of the videos (many of which aren't very well edit or written) are out of sequence since they deal with issues not yet relevant to the task at hand.  One early assignment is simply \"Create and submit a single homepage using your new domain url on either wordpress or another hosting space.\" with no instruction at all about how to do that (neither for creating the page nor submitting it).  I'd find another route to learning this than this course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy JD•Jun 17, 2019Glad I didn't pay for this. A quick video of what you are about to do then the rest is reading, links and assignments. Absolutely no video instructions, lectures or examples. Complete waste of timeThumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Brenda L•Jun 01, 2019There was very little actual teaching in this course.  I thought the PDF Mood board project was a great exercise, but that was honestly the only portion of this course that helped me learn anything.  There were no tutorials.  The videos were brief intros and the \"lessons\" linked to various articles from elsewhere on the web and didn't really give any instruction.  I feel like this course was a pretty big waste of time.  I could not have built a website based on the content of this course and its materials.  This was a disappointing offering from Coursera.  I've honestly learned more from Google searches on various aspects of web design than from this targeted course.

Like you can test a landing page - you pick a random person to perform a certain action on your landing page, and see where they struggle or what is unclear? If you did this with this course before going live, it would benefit everyone. Right now the quality of this course is too low, concepts are not explained enough, and the assignments (especially week 3) contain wrong instructions and errors.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (14)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Yaron K•Jan 26, 2019If you want to learn basic and inferential statistics - I would advise checking out the courses with these name from by University of Amsterdam(you can take them without taking the specialization). they are much clearer.

As of jan2019 the Python Notebook used for the week3 assessment had various problems.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (11)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Jin S•Mar 31, 2019This course attempts to cover very useful topics but falls short on several areas. 1. Multiple errors in the assignments. Practice exercises don't have any answers for students to check. 2. Course slides are not provided. 3. Lack of support to questions asked in forum.

I learned so much and understood some principles I did not understand when having read of them before.However in some notebooks, calculations were wrong or notbooks were missing alltogether (week 4, last jupyter notebook). Furthermore it can be annoying if you cannot trust a result of a statistical analysis in a notebook because there were other mistakes before. That's why I give you \"only\" 4/5 stars.

While they go though each statistical procedure clearly, I feel like a lot of underlying context is missing. What is the different between a z- and t-distribution? Why do we use those distributions? How do the different tests relate to each other? Etc. It feels like this course needed an extra 50-60 minutes of lecture time to tie all these concepts together. A textbook to follow along would have been great too.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Michael D•May 28, 2019This course is a good statistics course, but a poor Python course. Python is practically an after thought in each week's lesson as the focus in the lecturing learning methods is entirely verbal rather than supported by in lecture use of Python.

      "335  -means-  or Data Management and VisualizationFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Adam K•Apr 07, 2019The course doesn't really develop an understanding of Data Management and Visualization outside of the context of SAS or Python syntax. Also there are a number of points throughout the course that would benefit from an update most particularly the initial documentation to get started with SAS. The LIBNAME in the downloadable PDF is incorrect and it took me a significant amount of effort to identify and resolve the error since I was unfamiliar with the process.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (3)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Rebekah C•May 21, 2016This course states that it is for people with no knowledge in SAS.

Highly recommended.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy JMF•Sep 21, 2017I wanted to do the whole specialization this course is a part of, but the forums are inactive and questions go unanswered... You're also at the mercy of peer reviewers, who may grade unfairly if there are technical difficulties, and who may not grade you in a timely manner. (Or they don't submit their assignments so you can grade them in a timely manner.) The videos have WAY too much B-roll and not enough visual aids. I am a beginning Python coder and took this class to expand my Python knowledge, and I have a science background so I understand a lot of the math going on here, but I don't think this course would be a good choice for anyone without familiarity with Python.

      "349  -means-  Application Systems ProgrammingFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy steven c s•Feb 14, 2019This course is an embarrassment to Unity and should be taken down, remade, tested, then re-released.I give this course one star for the following reasons:I.  Unprofessional, convoluted Code from an outdated instructor.II. Everyone copy-paste's the instructor's code to pass.III. Horribly overpriced for what you getPart I: Unprofessional, convoluted code from InstructorThroughout this course, the instructor often supplies his code. Id like to argue that his code is unprofessional and goes against many good-coding-practices. Seeing unprofessional code from an instructor paid by Unity, let alone being instructed to use it to complete courses, is unfortunate to students and breeds bad programmers.Some students purchased this specialization because they wanted to learn a \"Unity-Approved\" way of making a game - they wanted to learn \"industry standards\". This course does not teach you these.Here are some examples I found in the instructors code to be unprofessional, bad practices: 1. Right off the bat, the instructor tells you to use Unity 3D to make a 2D asteroids game. https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/physics/physics-best-practices Here is a link from a Unity.com article stating that this is a bad practice. 2. The instructor has oddly spaced code and cluttered .cs files. The amount of commented code the instructor leaves in a solution is not professional. Especially when he is telling you to download his code. The instructor's code is cluttered with DEBUG_IF, SUMMARY, <PARA>, //Comment which makes the actual code very difficult to read. I am under the impression that commented code is a good thing if it descriptive and non-invasive. The instructor's code violates the non-invasive portion of that belief. The instructor also has some very odd code spacing where he tabs over two times after declaring a variable type - this leads to his code being difficult to read.3. The instructor violates the law of demeter - basically stating that if you are \"dotting\" into something more than twice, you probably need to rethink your approach. Dotting means \"Function.doThing().getThing.. etc.4. The instructor fails to optimize any part of his code.     a. The instructor keeps unused library imports at the top of his .cs files    b. The instructor declares many variables inside his Update loops when they could be promoted to               member variables.    c. The instructor uses non-performant functions such as comparing by tag with \".tag ==\" instead of                  \".CompareTag(TAG)\".     d. The instructor uses Update loops for code that affects physics - this should be done in a                                 FixedUpdate().    e.  The instructor makes no mention of ObjectPooling in a game that Instantiates objects left and right.     f. The instructor fails to demote variables/methods from public when they do not need to be.For reasons stated above, I believe that this instructor is not up to date with current Unity programming standards and shouldn't be teaching ANY want-to-be pro Unity programmer.5. The instructor has overly complex solutions for problems that do not demand it. Sometimes the                   instructor will use complex maths, create entirely new scripts, go the complete round about way of             doing something rather than thinking \"is there is a better way to do this?\".6. The instructor makes methods that \"kind of work\" but then creates additional \"helper                                     classes\" to really make it actually work. This is a problem that students often struggle with, not one             that teachers should struggle with. If your solution doesn't work 100%, re think it and do it again. 7. The instructor often switches between bracketing syntaxes. After he declares a method, he will                     sometimes put a bracket immediately to the right or below it. This makes code hard to read and is               considered bad practice. 8. The instructor uses uses no sort of inheritance or interface implementation in his code. The instructor        missed ample opportunities to use inheritance or interface implementation.Part II : Copy+paste to succeed - In this specialization, the instructor often mentions that \"[his] solution is not the only one\". I have programmed long enough to know that there is always a better solution than yours somewhere. As a programmer, it is a good idea to always believe their is no one concrete way of doing something.However, if you go through the courses believing this instructor, you will have a \"difficult\" time.In a video in week three, course 2, the instructor says \"if you've been working off of your own project, and working forward, which would be difficult...\". By the instructor saying that working off of your OWN SOLUTION would be difficult if taking this course, I felt he was effectively thinking and implying that students were and should be using the instructor's code. If true, he negates his comment \"my solution is not the only one\". This not only encourages a \"copy-paste\" mentality, but demands it to succeed. As a result, all but one of my 4 peer reviews I downloaded were simply copy-pastes of the instructor's code. Part III. Horribly overpriced for what you getThis course is $80. After completing this course - I feel ripped off for the quality that I received. There are better Youtube videos, more informative Udemy courses, and better optimized blog posts than this course. This course is the most disappointing online course I have ever purchased. Maybe second to the the first course within this specialization. One star because they tried to make a course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Jorge O•Dec 20, 2018Now that I took the Unity Certification Exam, I can say that the questions provided throughout this course ad infinitely easier than the questions on the exam, which led me to expect a much easier exam than it really was and cosequentelly taking it without being well prepared for it (which was supposed to be the objective of this preparation course).If the questions were ill suited for the purpose, the lessons provided were really even worse, I think I had lost more time trying to replicate what the instructor wanted, but really leaned very little by doing so!I'm sorry but I couldn't recommend this course to anyone. Since there are such good tutorial material online, it is a shame that  paid course, sponsored by unity, is in many ways inferior.Very disappointed, despite having had 98.5%, 100%, 100% and 100% as my Coursera courseware grade!Thumbs UpThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy David H•Dec 11, 2018Highly recommended!

I did not and know I am better programmer and having more patience with these systems. This course was great, I have learned a lot.

Analyses of concrete examples give definite insight into not only the image, written words and background of this image, but also the methodology, or tools with which this kind of analysis is possible. On top of that, I also would like to note a great attention to peculiar cultural elements, such as transformation of haiku or so-called pleasure districts, to name a few, which I find rather interesting.But beware, it's not a \"monographic\" type of work which will expose you to the complete set of all aspects of the knowledge, and neither this course will make you a specialist in this field, but nontheless it's a nice place to start if you have an interest in visual and/or literary culture of Japan in pre-modern and early modern times.All in all, I may fairly satisfied with this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Syn-Ti L•Jan 06, 2018Great introduction to Japanese art and literature!Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Andrew S•Nov 10, 2017Excellent course!

The course covers a breadth of topics - network protocols (HTTP, REST), IaaS vs PaaS, MVC model, Web Servlets and Controllers, DAO layer, different database strategies (relational vs NoSQL), deployment strategies. For my personal taste it would have been better to delve deeper into the different topics, which this course doesn't do. Instead it  covers a lot of different topics but mostly on the surface level. I think that makes it better for beginners to have a better grasp of the overall architecture of a back-end system. The practical assignments were well documented and will teach the student how to write controllers for a back-end application. Overall, I think this is a great course for beginners level.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy SHAOCHIN L•Aug 29, 2019This course has the basic acknowledge of spring boot help you build your own cloud service, but the course is too short that didn't include some advance such as spring-security, spring-message, etc. Hope professor could add more topic of this course.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Sridhar M•Sep 01, 2019Contents are good but it's good for beginners only.

Amazing community as well. Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Ramona A•Oct 04, 2015It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class. But the teacher (Bless his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics. It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal. That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all. Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too. I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons. If that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates. What's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Pablo M B•Mar 04, 2016The course material is very good. The most obvious issue with the course, is that peer revision takes a very long time, which means that you will get overdue assignments no matter what. For instance, after three weeks I'm still waiting for a revision that I wanted to use for the final workshop. I assume that instructor involvement in project revision is impossible in this kind of online course; but perhaps, if the issue is that people aren't getting their work reviewed, there could be an incentive for reviewers, for example, get an instructor/mentor review, if you submit at least, say, 10 thorough peer reviews.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy David B•Apr 01, 2016Designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time. Some of the facts about poetry aren't accurate. The effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material.

At first, wanting to keep true to my own style, I started with much trepidation but, right from the beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The whole process expanded my awareness and, rather than putting me in a straitjacket of style and substance, it expanded my horizons, sometimes with prompts that seemed totally impossible; particularly daunting were the lipogram, cinquain and Alexandrine, and yet the poems flowed.  This was a big revelation for me, as well as very exciting.I’m still surprised that I wrote many poems of which I’m so very proud, often working on both prompts.  The course moved me out of my comfort zone: for instance, with ‘The Table-Top Pencil Sharpener’, which was supposed to be pure image, but wouldn’t behave, and wrote itself anyway.  I would never have written a poem on this subject before, and yet it emerged.  Writing something so different on a subject so seemingly mundane, really cemented in my mind the possibility of writing poetry about anything, whilst filtering it through perception and imagination.Another aspect of the course that stands out for me are the peer reviews: both giving and receiving.  I was very lucky to have reviewed some fantastic poems, and most of the reviews I received were thoughtful and productive.  Going to try to use the comments box, now, to thank those who took the time to really consider the poems and their comments.The moderators were excellent, helping out with both technical aspects of the course and comments on poems.  There were some technical and navigational aspects of the website I struggled with: finding peer reviews, and lack of reviewers at certain times so having to reset deadlines, but the moderators stepped in very quickly.Even though the course has finished, I will still tackle some of the prompts not completed within the timeframe, due to deadlines (or as someone on the forums endearingly termed them - ‘deathlines’!)  The ‘conceit’, for one, and an already started new poem, using rhyme originally penned by a famous poet.Thank you for a concise yet truly inspirational course.  I will remember this time with great affection.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy tammy s•Sep 10, 2018i really enjoyed the whole class thank youThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Diego S•Sep 27, 2018awesome!Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Deleted A•Aug 25, 2018Interesting, useful and fun course with a unique (actually, unforgettable) instructor presentation style.

Thumbs UpThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Kate S•Dec 29, 2018I actually learnt a lot with this course. The lecturer's material was worth the first month's subscription. The main issue with the course is the assignments. Firstly, one of the tests was so difficult to pass (the one about how large an audience the slides would be suitable for). It really wasted my time to continually do that test in order to pass it and get to the next stage. I don't think it taught me much and I didn't want to have this happen again later. Secondly, the peer-graded assignments are a good idea but some students assign very bad marks without giving reasons and their own slides are low quality, which puts their judgement in doubt. I saw students complaining that they they got marked 0 for using the wrong font, even when they used the right font. Given my experience with a bad marker who set random scores, I'm not surprised. These people waste our time and I wish they could be filtered. For example, if people get consistently bad marks for their own slides, the marks they give should be worth less than the average person, because they are not a conscientious student anyway. In summary, because of the issues with the assignments that caused delays, I just listened to the course and didn't do the assignments. I wanted to push through the issues, but then just decided it wasn't worth it. The content was good.

There are a few problems, however. Minor quibbles: 1) The instructor does not really explain Parallel Perfect Fifths or Octaves; I had to look them up on my own. They deserve a whole lecture. 2) One of the assignment solutions has a Parallel Octave by contrary motion, which is not supposed to be allowed.3) He also neglected to explain the Harmonic Minor Key being used for minor chords in his Lecture 0 of Week 2. Just a very short explanation would have saved me 40 minutes of stressful researching, confusion, and doubts about my own sanity ;)\n",
      "The biggest problem: This course should really be an 8- or 12-week course. The weeks are very densely packed. In Week 2, I worked 3-4 hours every day, and then was greeted by 11 classes due in 7 days when I opened Week 3. The assignments are rated 10 or 20 minutes but actually take about 2 hours. It would often take me thirty minutes to an hour to get through one 5-15 minute video. (I do take detailed notes and do recall and mnemonic drills along the way, however). If you are already solidly grounded in music theory and have much of voice leading on autopilot, this class is faster. That said, I would not want him to cut out anything. Every class so far has been necessary. It has taken me from almost 0 musical theory understanding to feeling very comfortable with advanced concepts, all in an extremely short time.If you try to complete all of his video examples just before he does them, they work like a charm. I came here to get solid skills, and Just three weeks in I feel like I have made a years' worth of progress. I highly recommend this course, but know the kind of work you are getting into.

However, the main problem with the course is the peer-reviewed assignment. Since not many students are taking the course, the system couldn't supply four students' assignments to review, thus I had to search the forum for assignments to review (students who pasted links to their works and asked for reviews). In order to review four works, I had to search for assignments that were handed in more than a year ago... By the same token, not many students reviewed my work.

It's a great general review of the \"basics\". Even though I'm an experienced jazz and classical musician, I find that strong \"fundamentals\" are important to learn and relearn. And, considering my focus has, for so long a time, been on 20th and 21st century practices, I'm loving this opportunity to get back into earlier centuries of thinking. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven are totally worth understanding, even for those concentrated on so called \"modern\" ways of thinking and writing.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy fernando V S•Aug 05, 2017This is an Amazing Course.

Остальные задания можно было бы сделать посложнее.Минусы: лекции, они попросту ужасные, материал подан в сыром, можно даже сказать заученном виде, без должного количества примеров. Такое чувство, что лекторам было сказано уложиться в определенное время, которого явно не хватило. Было охвачено довольно много моментов языка, какой смысл делать по ним лекцию, лишенную какой бы то ни было практической составляющей, а потом даже не давать практического задания? (К примеру generic)P.S. Я бы не писал таких вещей о лекциях, если бы не видел, как это можно сделать лучше. Отличный пример - специализация от Яндека по С++.Тем не менее курс стоит того, чтобы его пройти - задания, как мне показалось, довольно хорошо сделаны, дают возможность на собственном опыте разобраться в тонкостях языка, а в качестве теории лучше просто почитать официальную документацию Apple, на которую, в общем-то, курс благополучно ссылается в дополнительных материалах.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Мурат•Jan 20, 2019Очень поверхностно все.

Had you met the untold and pretty high bar of prerequisites, then this course is valuable and definately worth 2  to 3 stars.This course is disorganized, fragmented, unstructured and throws absolutely everything at you. Some contents are repeative, unwanted, unnecessary. Getting the hardware is a problem. There are also traps such that they would make you to install the OS yourself, then teach you everything about the board, then show all the right ways that you could install OS's at the end. They would teach you about GPIOs and assign you homework, and at the very end, tell you how not use GPIOs to avoid damaging your board. They would quiz you things not taught in the lecture and hold you hostage until you give the exact string answers they are looking for, and all these on obsolete topics.

      "381  -means-  or Data Science Math SkillsFilled StarStarStarStarStarBy Robyn J•Feb 08, 2017This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept. \n",
      "Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, \"results\" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.\n",
      "The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.\n",
      "In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.\n",
      "Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.Thumbs UpThis is helpful (8)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Roberto S•Jul 24, 2017For newbies, the set theory, real numbers, basic statistics and so on are quite well explained.

Unfortunately as the course progress the course material and videos become less and less helpful. Ultimately the student has to visit other web sites and youtube to actual learn the expected material. The course notes are next to useless and the video are equally unhelpful. I am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course.

I have learned so many new things and increased my awareness of the true cost of fashion. I had no idea fashion was the second most polluting industry in the world, that it consumed so much energy and water and how it contributed to climate change and water pollution. I had stopped buying clothes for a while now because I have enough for my needs but if and when I do need something new I'm only going to buy second-hand clothing because I cannot in good conscience purchase anything new knowing the terrible social and environmental impact it has on the world. This course has completely changed how I look at fashion and what I will purchase in future. I love everything I own but now I value and appreciate them so much more. I did not know that you could grow your own clothes and that was such a cool thing to learn about. It's wonderful to know that sustainable alternatives to non-recyclable textiles and animal-derived leather is being produced.

Overall, well done.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Colin d L - H•Apr 26, 2016The course can be informative, but the presentation needs some work.  All of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a Power Point presentation to the viewer.  The \"in class\" examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual class.   In addition, the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited.  In multiple videos, there were typos.  In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide. When the revised slide was presented to the viewer,  a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence.  In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.    I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment.  I have no problem paying for a good product.  However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.    Thumbs UpThis is helpful \n",

If they are interested in offering a course on another topic, either together or separately, I would encourage you to have them do so.

      "418  -means-  or Entrepreneurship 2: Launching your Start-UpFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Ram M Y•Feb 03, 2019I only wish I found this course earlier - I quit a seven-figure job, with my last designation being Joint Managing Director, within a Public Listed Company in Sri Lanka to start two businesses of my own - it would have made the planning over the last 3 months faster and more structured. I use it now  to revalidate assumptions and planned strategies to pivot/amend my plans accordingly. The time spent on the programme pays back, perhaps 50-fold!Really practical and sensible information taught with the objective of actually guiding an entrepreneur in setting up a new business. The fact that there is focus on both, traditional and IT businesses clearly demonstrates the value of the skills being taught through simple practical examples. No component of this course has been made to appear more complicated than it is, hence bringing out the true value of the lecture team.

Code and tests quality is poor in my opinion.I would consider it as a overview of possible approaches, not a course. Assigments could be frustating because outcome is sometimes non-deterministic (I wasted few hours of my time because of this, it turned out that my solution was fine). Sometimes given examples are not following Java documentation in details. They could not work in corner cases. It should not be the case in the course made by professionals. Compared to the other courses I took authors of this one did not put much effort in preparing good materials and exercises. Course can by challenging by means of standing frustration assigments could give you. And in my opinion not because it is hard to pass them and they are demanding. It is because they are not properly prepared.I have mixed feeling about specializations. This topic can be hard.

It is unfortunate that my timing in participating in this class reduced my ability to properly interact with other students during the progress of the lessons, but I have to accept responsibility for that aspect.Still, I consider this to be one of the more exceptional courses offered by Coursera and credit that largely to the presentation skills of the good professor.

The course also discusses the problems that today's cities are facing. The coursework invites participants to really get to know their own cities, be analytical of their strong and weak points and finally challenges students into an exercise of choosing the best cities for them.The course examples seem slightly biased towards North American cities, so this would be a point to be addressed in future iterations. Finally, would be interesting to adapt the Place Finder tool for different demographics, since several steps within are only suitable for adult professionals.Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Dianne H•Oct 31, 2017Excellent course!

Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Lauren R•Oct 19, 2017I found this course to be derivative of the Project Launch course. There was little value added and a lot of repetition throughout the course. There was also the issue of the quiz questions not being specifically covered in the course material. For instance, in the Agile week 6 it was obvious the test questions were copied from an agile specific course as many of the questions were not covered and terms not defined in the previous course material.To improve, I would recommend to combine the Project Launch and Project Planning courses, and make it an 8 week course. With the additional course, create a course entirely devoted to Agile PM as this is an entirely different mindset with a different vocabulary than traditional PM.

J W•May 05, 2018I have learned that MB is only a tool and should never be considered anything else. Team members should take the survey at least twice in the beginning and then again, once a year, before their annual review. Interpreters (supervisors) should never use MB until they become certified and verified practitioners of Myers-Briggs. Untrained and those with minimal knowledge of how MB is interpreted could lead to problems. I also wonder why MB doesn't have a way to identify the naysayers, luddites, \"yes but\", anti-everything, negative team members. To some, MB sounds too goodie goodie. We all know that there are always negative, envious, jealous, lazy, unhappy and resentful employees and all the 16 Types are missing something. Just Saying!

I would like to thank University of Florida for taking up such an important course. This online program is very effective and excellent. The AV's on Emotional Intelligence is really excellent. The tyre meets the road. The content straight hits the purpose with application to work. Which is very important. The assessments of Week 2 - ( Assessment 1 and 3) and Week 3 ( Assessment on 360 degree feedback in relation to Emotional Intelligence and 2 ) is really excellent and a student needs to work very hard on it. If more details of BIG5 could have been introduced would make the course more informative.

Thumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Harry F•Apr 14, 2016The lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses  of the course.  While it is evident that each of the Roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history, saying that it was a Rooseveltian century is going a bit too far.  Nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the 20th century.  Wagner-Pyser, Glass-Steagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the UN we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights.  The only thing that has lasted has been Social Security and that is under attack by a co-opted ultra-conservative  CongresThumbs UpThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Michael T•Mar 15, 2016Some of this content is glaringly wrong e.g that F Roosevelt's freedoms weren't seen by him as inalienable rights, that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor's approach to freedom  that were distinctive from FDR.
